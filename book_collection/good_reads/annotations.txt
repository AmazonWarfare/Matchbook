'He had spent a lot of time thinking about himself, and had come to the conclusion that he was definitely not self-absorbed.'
'The guys from Norway, Magnus and Magnus, had little bits of fur on their robes as trim, which wasn’t necessary, as the shell made sure they were never cold. They were from the late nineties, and had both chosen their names to honor the world’s strongest man, Magnus Ver Magnusson. Their interests included Vikings, heavy metal, and fulfilling stereotypes.'
'Fix what? The timeline? The space-time continuum? Gnarly, unfillable plot holes?'
'Sometime around 1:30 in the morning, Martin learned the best thing about wizard parties, which is that because wizards can teleport, they can sleep in their own beds no matter how drunk they get or how far away the party was. Unfortunately, they still were susceptible to hangovers.'

Martin Banks is just a normal guy who has made an abnormal discovery: he can manipulate reality, thanks to reality being nothing more than a computer program. With every use of this ability, though, Martin finds his little “tweaks” have not escaped notice. Rather than face prosecution, he decides instead to travel back in time to the Middle Ages and pose as a wizard.

What could possibly go wrong?

An American hacker in King Arthur’s court, Martin must now train to become a full-fledged master of his powers, discover the truth behind the ancient wizard Merlin… and not, y’know, die or anything.
#
While Snooping through the file system of a cell service provider, Martin Banks, a 23 year old from Seattle WA, came across a 5TB text file called Repository1-c.txt. Out of Habit, Martin searched for and surprisingly found his name “Martin Kenneth Banks”. Martin noticed patterns in the files and eventually figured out what some of the values meant. One of the values appeared to be his height at 5ft 11in. He knew this was probably a more accurate measurement but since he has used 6ft 2in for his entire adult life, he decided to make the edit. This was Martin’s first change to the file and after urinating on the wall and noticing things he’d never noticed before, he realized that he just grew a few inches. After contemplating existentialism and debating whether or not to pretend he never found the file, curiosity won the day. He starts messing with the file again, discovering bank theft, levitation, teleportation and time travel. He had discovered that reality itself was a program and the source code for reality was right in front of him. After manipulating his bank account one too many times, he was arrested by a 2 person US Treasury Special Task Force comprised of Agent Murphy and Agent Miller. This Task Force was put together to investigate unexplainable bank fraud. Martin had already developed an app to give himself shortcuts to manipulate the file. One button would teleport him home and another was a bright red button that said “Escape”. When he was developing the escape function, he tried to consider a time and place where magic was both acceptable and awe inspiring. He decided on Medieval England and searched the internet for “Best time to live in Medieval England”. The third result was a book by Gilbert Cox titled The Best Years to Live in Medieval England. He chose the year 1150 for the time and the White Cliffs of Dover for the location. While being interrogated by the task force, he offered to show the agents how he manipulated his balance with his smartphone. When he was given his phone by the idiotic agents, he hit the home button. Suddenly appearing in his bedroom face to face with a different federal agent, he tapped the Escape button.

The Rotten Stump Edit
Martin found himself exactly when and where he programmed the file to take him. While en route to civilization, he was found by a woman driving a cart who introduced herself as Gwen, the tailor of Leadchurch. Gwen immediately recognized him as a Wizard (Martin was wearing his Draco Malfoy costume) and through an awkward conversation she informed him that Wizards were celibate, which was shocking, and that Leadchurch was the home of another Wizard. Gwen dropped Martin off at an Inn called The Rotten Stump and she took his measurements before continuing on her way. Inside the Rotten Stump, Martin attempts to wow the inkeep and his patrons with the evidence bag from his arrest, referring to it as "cloth that you can see through". Martin was hoping on getting free food and board but nobody was too impressed. The local wizard, Phillip showed up to greet Martin. Martin, believing Phillip to be a charlatan gets into a bit of tiff which results in Phillip challenging Martin to a Wizarding Duel. The format of the duel is to take turns showing off your spells, trying to 1-up the opponent until you can no longer do so. Martin, thinking he was going to easily win against the charlatan goes all out with his best trick, levitation. It wasn't true levitation mind you. Because gravity exists somewhere else in the file, Martin had to write a script that would constantly reset his altitude to 3 feet above the ground (10 times per second). This caused him to continually vibrate and was the source of extreme discomfort. Phillip, who knew how to program a constant into the file, flew 30 feet into the air effortlessly and shot a ball of light (we later learn this to be a 1 foot column of 200mph wind) at Martins chest which propelled him through the forest until he hit a tree and passed out.

The Charlatan Edit
Martin woke about 9 hours later to the smell of stew and a body full of ache. He was in Phillip's house. He learned that Phillip and Gwen went to retrieve him from the forest, where he was still levitating (later Gwen remarks that he must be a skilled Wizard to continue levitating after being knocked unconscious). Obviously Martin had a ton of questions swirling through his mind while he was inhaling the stew. Phillip seemed aware of this, so he went ahead and answered them without being asked. Phillip was from London but immigrated to the US where he found the file, using his Commodore 64, in the year 1983. Martin learned that many other people had also found the file and that some are intentionally directed to their time period via the Gilbert Cox book. The wizards have developed a script that buys enough copies of the book every year to keep it in circulation. According to Phillip, he was the first of the Medieval Europe Wizards to both find the file and to arrive. Jimmy (also known as Merlin), the chairperson of the Medieval Europe community, found the file 2 years after Phillip and arrived less than a week after. Soon after most of Martin's questions were answered, Phillip offered Martin a place in the Wizard training program as his apprentice. Since the only other option was to be sent back to his own time without access to the file and possibly hogtied and stripped naked, Martin enthusiastically agreed after first making sure he didn't have to be celibate. The Wizarding community typically takes turns training new Wizards and Martin should have gone to one of the Magnuses in Norway. Phillip had taken a liking to Martin, so he decided to handle the training himself.

Off To Be The Wizard Edit
The first step in his training was to visit Gwen's tailor shop to be fitted for a hat and robes. Against Phillip's warning, Martin asked Gwen out and received a not so friendly reply. While the two were in the shop, a farmer from the village of Rickard's Bend came in to complain that his clothes were stretching. Gwen assured the man that the material she uses does not stretch. Phillip took Martin on a tour of Leadchurch, which consisted of a few shops and of course the Church thats covered in lead. Every day at noon, the Bishop comes out and attempts to stick a magnet to the side of the building to prove that the church is made of lead.They eventually came to Phillip's shop where he maintains the illusion of being the local professional Wizard. It was a small space filled with jars and bottles full of fluids, spice jars and a work table. This is where the locals come to request favors from the local wizard. Phillip explains to Martin that they do take on the occasional job but that their primary job is to make it look like they are too busy to be bothered. Phillip already had an appointment scheduled for the day; they were to contain an ancient evil. They were asked by Mrs Abigail to move her goat from one Pen to the other. The ancient evil they were containing was Mrs Abigail. After being chased by a levitating goat, Martin returned with Phillip back to his shop where Phillip instructed him on how to clean and prepare his staff, the first instruction being DO NOT make the obvious joke. Phillip told Martin about arriving in medieval England and how he got into a huge argument with Jimmy over changing the timeline. He believed Jimmy as being too careless, afraid the timeline would be affected. As it turned out, nothing they do in medieval England has any impact whatsoever on the future. The ever doubtful Martin returned to the future to confirm what Phillip told him. While he was there, he found the perfect ornament for his staff, a souvenir he bought as a child on a trip to Mexico, a bust of El Santo, King of the Luchadores. Much like Martin's 3 function application on his cellphone, Phillip developed a similar program when he first arrived called The Shell. The Shell listens for verbal commands in poorly translated Esperanto, an international language developed in the late 1800s. To enable a user for The Shell, you must recite the incantation "Supren Supren, Suben Suben, Maldeskstra dekstra, Maldeskstra dekstra, Bee Aye Komenco" (translates to up up down down left right left right B A Start, which is the Konami Code). Reciting the incantation is just what enables a Shell user. To actually meet the criteria so the Shell will execute your commands, you must be dressed in the proper wizard attire (5 Foot Staff or an 18 inch wand, Robes with cuffs 2 feet in circumference and a conical hat no shorter than 12 inches).

The Necromancer of Skull Gullet Cave Edit
Just as Martin had had enough of Phillip's 10 year old stew that was his primary source of nourishment for the last couple days, Phillip gives him the news that they are going to his friend Gary's house for board games and pizza. Using the crystal ball to communicate with Gary, Phillip tells him that they are on their way over and Gary gives Phillip the locations code. Like every time someone informs Gary that they are coming, he makes sure you teleport standing in something that you do not want to be standing in. Martin meets the other 3 wizards that live close to leadchurch, Gary, a painter from the year 1992, Tyler, a writer from 2003 and Jeff, who is from 2021 and the first wizard Martin met who is from his future. Gary goes to the year 1992, visits a Pizza Hut and immediately takes his pizza into the bathroom where he travels back to medieval England. He makes another trip to 1992 to grab a six pack of diet pepsi. Martin ate the best bad pizza he has ever eaten and played the most enjoyable game of Risk hes ever played. Since Martin arrived in Leadchurch, he has had this feeling that all the locals want to do him harm but Phillip keeps telling him its paranoia. When Phillip goes for a pee outside, the other 3 tell Martin that he has good reason to be afraid. Jeff was once overheard mentioning that his wand was broken and a local pulled a knife on him. Luckily for Jeff, the wand still worked.

Kludge and The Bastards Edit
The next day, it was time to go for the rough fitting at Gwen's tailor shop, so she could make the final adjustments to the template and then make the robes out of more expensive material. In order to get the robes just right, Gwen asked about Martin's Staff. Martin had been looking forward to an opportunity to recite the description he had prepared about his staff's ornamentation. He told Gwen "This is the grim visage of the saint of the southern country, destroyer of the monsters and leader of men. He vanquished and later befriended the blue demon" [1] While at the shop, another resident of Rickard's Bend came in complaining about her jacket and pants growing. The woman also had to make a stop at the cobblers to complain about her shoes shrinking. When they made it back to Phillip's hut, Phillip began to serve stew. This is the same stew that has been boiling in the pot nonstop for an unknown period of time. Martin, sick of Phillip's month old stew, left to find sustenance else where. He recalled seeing a vendor with a fruit cart somewhere in town, so he mad his way to downtown Leadchurch. On the way, he ran into the local gang lead by a large man named Kludge. Kludge had asked Martin to show him what he has learned from the town Wizard in an attempt to provoke Martin into a fight. The only things Martin could do with the shell were levitating, copying and destroying. He didn't want to pay off Kludge by the using kopio because he knew Kludge would just keep coming back. Destroying Kludge wasn't an option; they are wizards not murderers. They only thing left in Martin's toolbox was levitation, so Martin had to come up with a creative way to use it. His first move was to levitate and throw Kludge back but doing so also threw Martin back. After a few more ideas, Martin had Kludge hanging from the steeple of the church. Martin returned the Phillip's hut for a nice hot bowl of stew. Phillip seemed to know what just happened to Martin because he immediately decided to teach him more defensive spells. Learning how to cast beams and rays was the next lesson on the agenda. Some are for show and some are actually functional but non of them look both cool and are functional at the same time. This limitation was the perfect introduction to macro building.

The Exorcism of Donald Melick Jr Edit
Before Phillip could start working with Martin on Macros, he remembered that he had scheduled an appointment. Two weeks prior, Phillip had agreed to help Bishop Galbraith perform an exorcism on the young Donald Melick Jr. They arrived to meet the bishop in your typical extravagant wizard fashion when the sun was at its highest point in the sky. At the Melick family's home, they learned that Donald Jr has been withdrawn and irritable; he had taken to hiding himself in his room and requiring privacy. He was hanging around with The Bastards (Kludge's gang) Donald Sr was a mans man. He enjoyed hunting, fishing and farming. After having 3 daughters, he was ecstatic to learn he was to have a son; someone who he could share with his love for hunting, fishing and farming. Donald Jr was practically raised and spoiled by 4 mothers (his mother and his 3 older sisters), so he didn't exactly meet Donald Sr's criteria for the perfect son. Because of this not so odd behavior from the teenage boy, Donald Sr suspected Donald Jr must be possessed by the devil. The bishop and the wizards went out to the shed that Donald Jr had claimed as his bedroom. They left Donald Sr and the family behind, convincing them that what was to take place was not for their eyes and could be harmful to any witnesses. Donald Jr was hesitant and had a bad attitude towards them until the bishop proved to Donald Jr that he knew what he was going through with his family. The relieved Donald Jr embraced the bishop. The four of them discussed how they were going to put on a show for Donald's parents and how the bishop was going to give Donald's parents a list of post-exorcism instructions such as giving Donald his privacy and leaving him alone when he wanted to be left alone. Martin's part of the show was to get a tray, get booze and to make sure one of the family members witnesses part of the the exorcism. When Martin went to obtain the cider, Donald Sr demanded to see what was going on. Acting reluctant, Martin walked Donald Sr back to the shed where they found Donald Jr hovering 10 feet above the bed. Donald Jr had the attitude like he had returned from a long trip and then he projectile vomited all over his father. Martin recognized the fake vomit immediately, stew. Phillip pulled 4 glasses out of his hat, poured the cider and said "The bishop and I are now going to teach the two of you...how to play pinochle" [2]

Merlin Edit
Because macro building required some heavy programming, it wasn't very practical to do it on a phone. Martin ordered a laptop from Amazon and went back to 2013 to get it. The federal agents were banging on the door when Martin ran downstairs to grab his package. Another package had arrived for him. He realized that it was probably something he orders in the future, so he left it behind. We find out later that the package was modern computer in the case of a Commodore 64. He told his parents that he didn't do whatever it was the federal agents were accusing him of and then ran upstairs to travel back to Leadchurch. Martin and Phillip spent almost the entire day setting up and optimizing Martins new laptop. The repository allowed them to set the battery to have constant full charge. The most futuristic tech Phillip had seen since arriving in England was Gary's powerbook, so showing him a laptop from 2012 was like giving a caveman a tour of the 21st century. While Phillip was walking Martin through The Shell's GUI, they both suddenly got goosebumps. Phillip knew, what Martin didn't, that getting goosebumps meant Jimmy was about to arrive. Phillip told Martin that he was about to witness a textbook example of how many effects could be layered into a single macro. A gust of wind blew through the room from all directions focusing on a single point in the center. After the light dimmed, a whirlwind started to form. The whirlwind started glowing, taking the shape of a human figure. After a loud explosion, a marble statue of Jimmy appeared in the spot where the whirlwind had just vanished. A light in the hand of the statue started to burn the statue. The wind blew away the ash and revealed the real life version of Jimmy, which was far less impressive than the statue, standing in the center of the room. Jimmy greeted Phillip and introduced himself to Martin as Merlin, the chairman of their wizarding community. Jimmy took Martin aside and spoke to him for a few seconds until they very much annoyed Phillip interrupted. The two, who obviously loathed each other bickered back and forth until Jimmy finally left. Martin couldn't understand Phillip's hatred towards Jimmy because he seemed nice enough but as it turned out, that was one of the reasons Phillip disliked him.

Flugi Edit

The following day, Phillip startled Martin into waking and told him he had a surprise for the days training. Martin kept grumbling about learning macros until Philip asked if he would rather learn to fly another day. It was time to fly!! Gary and Jeff were waiting for them in a clearing a couple miles a way. Phillip noticed Tyler wasn't with them which was a big deal since the local wizards always come out for an apprentices first flight. Jeff and Gary said that Tyler went to do some research for his novel the previous day and has yet to return. Martin spoke the command for flying, "Flugi" and shot up into the air. He seemed to be doing very well until he encountered a duck. Martin used his staff arm to shield his face. Since the staff is used to control your movements while flying, Martin lost control and plummeted to the ground. The other three wizards started in his direction at full speed and Phillip shot a ball of blue light at the ground right before Martin landed. Being a recognized wizard by the shell grants you protection from injury but it does not protect you from pain. Martin hit the ground at full force and felt every bit of it. He bounced into the air and then hit the ground again. Phillip mentioned that Martin would have missed the duck had he not reacted.The next day was spent covering the rest of the material that Martin needed to pass the trials and reviewing old material. They covered conjuring which is basically copying objects without actually having the original object and Phillip explained to Martin the practical functions of the robes and hats. The reason why the cuffs need to have a circumference of 2 feet is because The Shell is looking for hand gestures and movements. The wizard's conical hat is the default location for all.

The Robe Edit

A few days later, Martin and Phillip went to Gwen's shop to pick up Martin's robe.In Gwen's shop was stacks and and stacks of peoples clothes. Every single person in the village of Rickard's Bend have been bringing in their clothes, claiming that their clothes grew. Martin used this as an opportunity to get some alone time with Gwen by asking her if he could magic the clothes back to their owners. Gwen declined. Martin opened the package that was given to him and was amazed at the sight of his new ensemble. The robe was made of a highly reflective silver fabric that resembled a disco ball.The trim was a similar but less reflective fabric that looked identical to the fabric that made up Santo's mask. Martin was relieved to not longer be wearing the blood red and black loaner robe that Phillip used to wear during his necromancer days. Martin tested his new robe with a couple spells and tested his hat by pulling out a couple of burritos. After they finished eating their burritos, Phillip dropped the bomb telling Martin that the trials were in 2 days. Every wizard in their medieval Europe would travel to Camelot to attend a dinner hosted for Martin. Martin would perform his salutation, which is something every wizard creates as a demonstration of their powers, and the trials would be held the following day. If Martin were to fail the trails, he would lose the ability to use anything with an integrated circuit or computer chip and then hogtied and left for Agents Murphy and Miller to pick up in 2012. No pressure. Martin spent the next 2 days working on his salutation, getting info from both Gary and Jeff without revealing what he was going to do.In Phillip's shop, he has a 2nd floor that nobody is allowed to enter.People aren't just not allowed but the shell makes it physically impossible for them to enter. Nobody knew what he was doing in the room and Martin grew more suspicious when he went to visit him while taking a break from macro work.

The Wonderful World of Camelot Edit
Camelot

Two days later, Phillip spoke the words to take him and Martin to London. Martin seemed surprised when they arrived in the middle of a pasture. Phillip noted to Martin that if it were 1000 years in the future, they would be standing in front of a curry restaurant. They walked through farms toward the river James (pronounced "Jems" and renamed from Thames) where the castle Camelot was located and then through the city. The castle and the wall surrounding the castle were covered in gold. As they got closer, Martin noticed a golden statue of the royal family and Jimmy in the middle of the reflecting pond. The very much exagerated statue of Jimmy had a name tag on his robe that spelled out "MERLIN". The metal on top of Jimmy's hat was discolored. After asking one of the locals, Martin learned that "unspeakable muck" would fall from the sky onto Jimmy's statue. After hearing that stew came from the sky several days prior, Martin then realized the source of the "unspeakable muck" was Phillip's toilet because it was he who poured the stew in. Once inside the great hall inside the castle, Phillip told Martin the history of how it was built all the while criticizing Jimmy for abusing the locals. They started for the dinning table at the end of the hall and surprisingly, Jimmy seated Martin at the head of the table. He then walked Martin around the table, introducing him to all of the wizards of medieval Europe with the exception of Tyler who was still missing. Jimmy's assistant and best friend, Eddie called for a speech.Jimmy did his song and dance and called on Martin to perform his salutation.

The Salutation and The Trials Edit
Martin pulled a small wooden box out of his robe and started speaking to the make imaginary imp inside. After speaking his macro's command, "starigis la scenejo" (translation: set the scene), Martin flew head first into box, shrinking as he entered it. The box disappeared and reappeared across the hall where it was floating. White smoke came seeping out of the box and onto the ground where it formed a statue of Martin. He grabbed his staff with both hands, raised it in the air like a Tusken Raider and said "Eh Neeek Chock" (translation not found). Martin exploded into thousands of boxes that formed another giant statue of Martin. The giant statue of Martin pulled out a giant boom box which started to play Rockit by Herbie Hancock. The giant statue of Martin started doing the robot and threw in some break dancing moves. While on its side, it formed its hand into a gun and on a specific downbeat in the song, the statue pulled the trigger. In that moment, everything collapsed to the ground and disappeared. Everybody cheered. Jimmy took Martin aside and told him that he wanted he wanted Martin to come live in Camelot after the trials. Everyone spent the rest of the night getting shitfaced and they all went back to their homes to get as much sleep as they could before the trials. Phillip and Martin both woke up the next morning with hangovers and spent about 2 hours getting some last minute cramming in. Jimmy called and asked if Martin was ready to face the trials, so they transported back to Camelot, directly to the round table. They were both on a raised platform surrounded by all of the wizards who attended the dinner the previous night. After the very irritable Phillip bickered back and forth with Jimmy asked "Martin, do you feel ready to leave your life as an apprentice behind and take on the powers and responsibilities of a wizard?"[3] Martin responded in the affirmative and there was silence for what seemed like minutes. Jimmy responded "OK". After another minute of silence, Martin finally asked them if they were just screwing with him. After everybody was done laughing, Jimmy informed him that the trials were over. Phillip explained to Martin that the trails truly started the minute he arrived and the salutation was his final test. Martin was officially a Wizard. After another day of partying, they went back to Phillip's hut where Phillip immediately told Martin to find another place to live. Martin stayed that night at the Rotted Stump and then asked Jimmy to help him find a home in Camelot.

The Hobbits of Rickard's Bend Edit
A few days later, Martin received a call from Gary who sounded distressed.Gary asked Martin to meet him and Jeff at Skull Gullet Cave. When Martin arrived, he noticed Gwen was also there and also visibly distressed. For Martin's benefit, Gwen resummarized the events that brought her to Gary's home. After Gwen finished altering all the clothes for the residents of Rickard's Bend, she loaded up her wagon and headed to the village. She found all the villagers dead when she arrived. Their deaths weren't caused by any apparent means, so she thought the wizards might know the cause. Gary was the closest wizard, so that is how she ended up in Skull Gullet Cave. They had already attempted to contact Phillip but they assumed he was in his private attic doing "nothing". Moments later, the four of them teleported to the outskirts of Rickard's Bend to investigate the deaths. From that distance, they could already tell that something weird was going on and they found the bodies as they got closer. The three wizards could see a pattern forming and started giving each other glances, knowing what the other was thinking. Someone was trying to make hobbits. Not just someone but definitely another wizard. After they verbally expressed their suspicion about it being wizards work, they heard a loud voice say "That's what we thought!!". Kludge and several other non-wizards knocked them all out and disarmed them. Martin came to and found himself tied to Jeff, Gary and a large tree. Martin's smart phone was still in his pocket but his hands were tied together. Donald Melick Jr, a reluctant member of Kludges gang, came over to talk to Martin. He apologized and said he would try to think of a way to get them out. Once the rabble noticed they were awake, they took Gwen, who was seated on a stump near them and threw her over to the three wizards. Martin noticed Gwen put her hood up and fiddle with her measuring stick. He started to pity her since she was in the wrong place at the wrong time and with the wrong people. Kludge's goal was to get the group to show him how to do magic and expected that threatening them and Gwen would do the trick. Gary told him that they would never talk. After Kludge ordered one of the gang members to "hurt the girl", Gwen snapped her measuring stick into two equal 12 inch pieces, pulled out both sleeves with her thumbs, exposing more fabric and performed her salutation with the command "NO!!". A bright light emitted from her and the thug who was barely touching her flew 20 feet into a wall. Gwen had Kludge's gang untie the wizards by threatening to throw Kludge into the fire. Martin took Donald Jr hostage and the 5 of them retreated, taking sanctuary in the lead church of Leadchurch.

Phillip's Secret Edit
Once Bishop Galbreath got over the fact that 3 wizards, the tailor and Donnie Jr suddenly appeared in his church, they began discussing who might have killed an entire village of people. Martin, Jeff and Gary all gave each other glances and were forced to say that they believed Phillip fit the criteria. For what had probably been years, Phillip had spent a ton of time locked in the 2nd story of his shop. He was incredibly secretive about it and nobody else was allowed up there. Martin eventually convinced them that Phillip needed to be ruled out, so they went to Phillip's shop to confront him. Phillip was extremely shocked and hurt that Martin would suspect him and knowing they would just go to Jimmy, he took them upstairs. In the middle of his room was Phillip's White Pontiac Fiero. Everyone knows that its impossible to transport complex objects, so it was assumed that Phillip disassembled, transported each piece individually and reassembled the car in his workshop. Everyone was amazed.

Tyler's Story Edit
Everyone began hearing the growling of a dog and Gary mentioned that he had been hearing the same dog for weeks. Phillip, dumbfounded, said to no one in particular "Stand here!". After a few keystrokes, Tyler appeared in the spot Phillip was pointing, out of breath, dying of thirst and bursting at the seams. His first words were "Mia Bancambro" which translates to "My Bathroom". Tyler returned and after calling his friends idiots, he told everyone the story about how he was ghosted. There are very few rules the wizards have and ghosting someone breaks just about all of them.

Many appreciate Richard P. Feynman's contributions to twentieth-century physics, but few realize how engaged he was with the world around him—how deeply and thoughtfully he considered the religious, political, and social issues of his day. Now, a wonderful book—based on a previously unpublished, three-part public lecture he gave at the University of Washington in 1963—shows us this other side of Feynman, as he expounds on the inherent conflict between science and religion, people's distrust of politicians, and our universal fascination with flying saucers, faith healing, and mental telepathy. Here we see Feynman in top form: nearly bursting into a Navajo war chant, then pressing for an overhaul of the English language (if you want to know why Johnny can't read, just look at the spelling of “friend”); and, finally, ruminating on the death of his first wife from tuberculosis. This is quintessential Feynman—reflective, amusing, and ever enlightening.
#
In the first lecture, "The Uncertainty of Science" Feynman explains the nature of science, that it is a "method for finding things out", and that it is "based on the principle that observation is the judge of whether something is so or not".[3] He says that uncertainty and doubt in science is a good thing, because it always keeps the door open for further investigation.[1] The lecture is structured around three topics: the activity of "doing" science, the body of scientific knowledge, and the application of science, which Feynman covers in reverse order. Feynman also emphasizes the distinction between questions that science can answer: "what will happen", and questions science cannot answer: "what do I want to happen".

The second lecture, "The Uncertainty of Values" deals with his views on the relationship between science, religion and politics. Feynman acknowledges science's limitations and says that it does not have the value system that religions have, but adds that it can be used to help in making decisions.[8][9] He also stresses the importance of having the freedom to question and explore, and criticizes the (then) Soviet Union by saying that no government has the right to decide which scientific principles are correct and which are not.[10]

In the third lecture, "This Unscientific Age", the longest of the three, Feynman discusses his views on modern society and how unscientific it is. Using a number of anecdotes as examples, he covers a range of topics, including "faith healing, flying saucers, politics, psychic phenomena, TV commercials, and desert real estate".[4]

'So, this is a rabbit, I thought. He sort of looks like Chester, only he's got longer ears and a shorter tail. And a motor in his nose.'
'Fangs are more pointed, and vampires use fangs to bite people on the neck.'
'Yech! Who'd want to do that?'
'Vampires would, that's who.'
'Wait a minute. I saw Mrs. Monroe bite Mr. Monroe on the neck once. Does that mean she's a vampire?'

BEWARE THE HARE!
Is he or isn't he a vampire?

Before it's too late, Harold the dog and Chester the cat must find out the truth about the newest pet in the Monroe household -- a suspicious-looking bunny with unusual habits... and fangs!
#
We are first introduced to the Monroes, including the boys, Pete and Toby, as they return home from the movies on a dark and stormy night. Harold, the dog, notices that they return with a small bundle. The bundle turns out to be a rabbit they found at the theater, with a note tied around his neck written in an ancient Carpathian dialect. The rabbit has two tiny fangs and a black pattern on his back that looks like a cape. After some discussion the family decides to adopt him, and since they found him at the movie Dracula they decide to name him Bunnicula.

Shortly after adopting Bunnicula, the family notices vegetables mysteriously turning white. Chester, the cat, notices that in each of the vegetables there are two tiny holes. After reading a book on vampires, a jealous Chester becomes convinced that Bunnicula is a vampire. He notes that Bunnicula sleeps all day, appears to be able to get out of his cage on his own, and has tiny fangs, which Chester believes he uses to suck vegetables dry. Chester then convinces Harold to help him prove this by catching Bunnicula in the act. He strews himself, and Bunnicula's cage with garlic. This succeeds only in causing Mrs. Monroe to give him a bath. Later, after reading about killing vampires with a stake through the heart, Chester tries to punch a (meat) steak through the sleeping rabbit's heart. It doesn't do anything but confuse the poor rabbit, since it is just steak/meat. Finally, he tries to drown the rabbit by tossing his water dish on him. This behavior results in Chester being locked outside.

As the story progresses Harold refuses to cooperate in Chester's antics. With Chester no longer speaking to him, he begins to take a liking to Bunnicula. After a few days he notices that Bunnicula is beginning to look ill. He stays up late one night and discovers that Chester is putting on garlic and blocking Bunnicula from feeding, essentially starving the poor rabbit. Harold decides to act, and that evening before Chester awakes he takes Bunnicula out of his cage and places him in the family's dinner salad. But before the rabbit can feast Chester chases him off, and lands in the salad himself. At this point the family decides to take Chester to the vet to address his strange behavior. They also decide to take Bunnicula to the vet as they notice he seems ill. At the vet Chester is prescribed cat therapy. Bunnicula is put on a vegetable, liquid diet. He takes to this so well, that the family decides to keep him on it permanently, at which point the mysterious white vegetables stop turning up. However, the Monroes attribute the strange white vegetables to a vegetable blight at their supermarket, and change stores. The novel ends with the Monroes remaining blissfully unaware of Bunnicula's strange feeding habits, and the danger Chester believes them to be in.[6]

After a mean collector named Swindle cons him out of his most valuable baseball card, Griffin Bing must put together a band of misfits to break into Swindle's compound and recapture the card. There are many things standing in their way -- a menacing guard dog, a high-tech security system, a very secret hiding place, and their general inability to drive -- but Griffin and his team are going to get back what's rightfully his . . . even if hijinks ensue.
This is Gordon Korman at his crowd-pleasing best, perfect for readers who like to hoot, howl, and heist.

A smart, young boy named Griffin Bing decides to invite his entire school grade over for a sleepover in an old house about to be demolished after the town's plan for using as a new space in their town to make a skate park was thrown out because of their youth. However, on the night of the sleepover, only Griffin and his best friend Ben Slovak show up. The two boys miraculously find a vintage baseball card. The card was a 1920 Babe Ruth trading card worth $974,000. S. Palomino, or Swindle as the boys call him stiffed them and gave them only 120 dollars for the card. The boys soon group up with a few other people and decide to steal the card back in an elaborate heist.
