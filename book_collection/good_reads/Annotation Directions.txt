DIRECTIONS:
Using a plain text editor (not word!) type in the values for each book, putting each value on its own line.
Only input the values, not the headers.
For the annotations that can have multiple entries, we use a # on a newline to represent the last entry. If there aren't any entries for a particular annotation type, like one of the tags, still include the # symbol. It is okay to have something like this:
#
#
When finished, save as a .txt file and upload it to Jared's branch in the folder book_collection/good_reads.
Below is the general format for each book. To start a new book, start again from the file name on the next line after the last #.

All of this information should be available on Good Reads. For the tags, I looked at the names of the book lists that the book was included in and selected tags from those. It is definitely the most labor intensive part, since you actually have to consider whether the tag would be a good fit and what type of tag it would be. It's still not that hard though. I believe in you guys! Feel free to ask me if you are unsure if you tag ideas are good or not.

At the bottom, I have listed all the current tags. Please update this list as you annotate.

When entering tags, please use all CAPS for consistency and be mindful of the plurality. For example, How do you feel about "love story" doesn't sound nearly as good as How do you feel about "love stories".

Quotes (They should be in single quotes so that quotes that span multilines will still be kept together.)---- quotes example:
'"What did you spend so much time talking about with Ila? If you weren't dancing with that long-legged fellow, you were talking to her like it was some kind of secret."
"Ila was giving me advice on being a woman," Egwene replied absently. He began laughing, and she gave him a hooded, dangerous look that he failed to see.
"Advice! Nobody tells us how to be men. We just are."
"That," Egwene said, "is probably why you make such a bad job of it."'
'I will hate the man you choose because he isn't me, and love him if he makes you smile.'

'I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.'
'I must learn to be content with being happier than I deserve.'
'I have not the pleasure of understanding you.'
'It is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are they the result of previous study?'

Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.
