'"And so the lion fell in love with the lamb…" he murmured. I looked away, hiding my eyes as I thrilled to the word.
"What a stupid lamb," I sighed.
"What a sick, masochistic lion."'
'"I decided as long as I'm going to hell, I might as well do it thoroughly."'
'"Even more, I had never meant to love him. One thing I truly knew - knew it in the pit of my stomach, in the center of my bones, knew it from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, knew it deep in my empty chest - was how love gave someone the power to break you"'
'"Don't be self-conscious, if I could dream at all, it would be about you. And I'm not ashamed of it."'
'"I said it would be better if we weren’t friends, not that I didn’t want to be."'
'"What if I'm not a superhero. What if I'm the bad guy?"'
':You’re still waiting for the running and the screaming, aren’t you?"'

About three things I was absolutely positive.

First, Edward was a vampire.

Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.

And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.

Deeply seductive and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight is a love story with bite.
#
Bella Swan is a seventeen-year-old introvert girl who moves from Phoenix, Arizona to Forks, Washington on the Olympic Peninsula to live with her father, Charlie. Her mother, Renée, is traveling with her new husband, Phil Dwyer, a minor league baseball player. Bella is admitted to Forks High School, where she easily befriends many of the students. A somewhat inexperienced and shy girl, Bella is dismayed by several boys competing for her attention.

On the first day of her school, Edward Cullen, a mysterious and beautiful boy stares at Bella, frustrated. Bella sits next to Edward in biology class, but he seems to be utterly repulsed by her, much to her bewilderment. He disappears for a few days but when he returns, he is unexpectedly friendly to Bella. Their newfound relationship is interrupted after Bella is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot. Edward saves Bella, narrowly stopping the van with his bare hands. Bella questions Edward about how he saved her life but he refuses to tell anything.

During a campout, she meets Jacob Black, a local boy from the Quileute tribe. She learns from him that Edward and his family are actually vampires who consume only animal blood. Disturbed and riddled by recurring nightmares, Bella researches about vampires. She compares the characteristics of the vampires in mythology to the Cullens. Convinced that he is a vampire, she finds herself in a state of enigma. Bella is saved by Edward again in Port Angeles when she is almost attacked by a group of men. Furious, Edward drives Bella away and takes her to a restaurant for dinner and then back home. On the way, she tells him of the stories that he is a vampire. Seeing that there's no point denying, he agrees to it. He confesses that Bella's blood is more desirable to him than to any other vampire. He wanted to kill her on the first day of school. He tried to stay away so that he couldn't hurt her. Over time, Edward and Bella fall in love.

Their relationship is affected when a nomad vampire coven arrives in Forks. James, a tracker vampire, who is intrigued by Cullen's relationship with a human, wants to hunt Bella for sport. Bella and Edward are forced to separate as Bella escapes with Alice and Jasper (Edward's brother and sister), to hide in a hotel in Phoenix.

James calls Bella and claims to be holding her mother hostage. Bella sneaks out and hurries to save her mother. When she arrives at the place, she finds that the entire hostage thing was a ruse. James attacks her. But before he can kill her, she is rescued by Edward and the other Cullens and James is killed. But Bella is already bitten by James. Edward prevents her from becoming a vampire by sucking the venom out of her wound, and she is treated at a hospital by putting up a story that she fell out of a window.

After they return to Forks, Edward takes her to the school prom as Edward didn't want Bella to miss any human experience because of him. Bella says that she wants to become like him, a vampire, but Edward is totally against this.

Bella's desire to become a vampire increases throughout the series. Edward continues to refuse as he thinks being a vampire is being a monster, and does not want Bella to suffer the same fate.

The Monk of Mokha is the exhilarating true story of a young Yemeni American man, raised in San Francisco, who dreams of resurrecting the ancient art of Yemeni coffee but finds himself trapped in Sana’a by civil war.

Mokhtar Alkhanshali is twenty-four and working as a doorman when he discovers the astonishing history of coffee and Yemen’s central place in it. He leaves San Francisco and travels deep into his ancestral homeland to tour terraced farms high in the country’s rugged mountains and meet beleagured but determined farmers. But when war engulfs the country and Saudi bombs rain down, Mokhtar has to find a way out of Yemen without sacrificing his dreams or abandoning his people.
#
Dave Eggers’s The Monk of Mokha (2018), the third in a series of nonfiction books in which Eggers explores the lives of modern-day immigrants in America, tells the real-life story of Yemeni-American Mokhtar Alkhanshali.

Mokhtar tells his girlfriend, Miriam, that he intends to go to law school. She purchases a beautiful leather satchel for him; Mokhtar borrows money from his brother Wallead to purchase a new laptop for school. He puts the laptop in the satchel and then drives to a fund-raiser for Somali famine victims, collecting $3,000 there, which he decides to drive to the mosque to delivery personally. He is also asked to bring leftover rooh afza (milk and rosewater) to the mosque. He falls asleep on the way and gets out of the car groggily. He sets the satchel down to help carry the rooh afza inside. By the time he remembers that he has left the satchel by the car, it has been stolen. Later, he accompanies his friend Ibrahim Ahmed Ibrahim to the airport, and sits there for hours, uncertain what to do.

Mokhtar works as a "lobby ambassador" (a.k.a. a doorman) at an apartment building in San Francisco. Good at the job, he is amazed at the way people spend their money. Most of the residents, while polite, do not ask Mokhtar personal questions. However, one resident, James Blackburn, asks him where he is from originally. Mokhtar was born in the United States and grew up in a poor neighborhood in San Francisco called the Tenderloin District. His parents came from Yemen. Mokhtar behaved badly as a child, so when he was thirteen, his parents arranged to send him to Yemen to live with his grandparents for a year.

Mokhtar was surprised to find he liked Yemeni culture and enjoyed his time there. His grandfather, a very hard worker, did not tolerate anything less from Mokhtar, and so Mokhtar learned the value of hard work and discipline while in Yemen. When Mokhtar returns to America, he gets a job on his own, working as a salesperson in stores. Later, he gets a job selling cars, but when he witnesses his boss ripping off customers, he quits in disgust.

While out on a date with Miriam, she points out a statue depicting a Yemeni man drinking coffee to Mokhtar. Taken by this image, Mokhtar does some reading, discovering that Yemen is where the first coffee was brewed, but years of internal strife and civil war have decimated the Yemeni coffee industry. Although he did not drink much coffee, Mokhtar decides he will launch a business importing coffee from Yemen to America. He studies coffee brewing and meets Willem Boot, who offers to fund a trip to Yemen.

Mokhtar travels to Yemen and stays for three months, going from coffee farm to coffee farm. He collects samples from each one, which he brings back to America with him, organizing taste tests with coffee experts, who help him identify the farm that produces the best beans. Armed with this knowledge, he returns to Yemen, visiting the farm, which is inefficiently run. Mokhtar helps the farmers improve their techniques to up their coffee yield.

Mokhtar searches for a processing plant, but finding that the local mills have shockingly poor conditions for the workers, he establishes his own mill. He goes to the other mills, stealing their employees simply by offering better pay and a better standard of working and living.

Everything is going well, and Mokhtar believes he might yet be successful. Then the worst happens: The violence and division in Yemen explode into all-out civil war. The U.S. Embassy hastily closes and evacuates—leaving behind any U.S. citizen still in Yemen. Mokhtar finds himself trapped in a war zone with no clear way to return to America. Worse, he needs to attend an upcoming coffee conference in order to secure orders for his coffee, or he will be unable to pay back his investors and the business will fail.

Mokhtar places several coffee samples into his suitcase and hires a boat. He travels across the Red Sea to Djibouti, where he boards a plane to the U.S., arriving just in time to attend the conference. His coffee is of such high quality that it is an instant hit; Mokhtar is inundated with orders and offers of investment. Despite the war, he begins importing coffee from Yemen, and his coffee quickly becomes some of the most famous coffee in the world.

Mokhtar rents an apartment in the same building where he once worked as a doorman. Initially, he is sad that he has no one to celebrate with, but then Dave Eggers, the author, arrives at his new apartment, and they celebrate the moment.

Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.

Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.

Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come.
#
Harry Potter has been living an ordinary life, constantly abused by his surly and cold aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley and bullied by their spoiled son Dudley since the death of his parents ten years prior. His life changes on the day of his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, delivered by a half-giant named Rubeus Hagrid after previous letters had been destroyed by Vernon and Petunia. Hagrid details Harry's past as the son of James and Lily Potter, who were a wizard and witch respectively, and how they were murdered by the most evil and powerful dark wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort, which resulted in the one-year-old Harry being sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Voldemort was not only unable to kill Harry, but his powers were also destroyed in the attempt, forcing him into exile and sparking Harry's immense fame among the magical community.

Hagrid introduces Harry to the wizarding world by bringing him to Diagon Alley, a hidden street in London where Harry uncovers a fortune left to him by his parents at Gringotts Wizarding Bank, receives a pet owl, Hedwig, various school supplies, and a wand. There, he is surprised to discover how famous he truly is among witches and wizards. A month later, Harry leaves the Dursleys' home to catch the Hogwarts Express from King's Cross railway station's secret Hogwarts platform, Platform ?9 3/4. On the train, he quickly befriends fellow first-year Ronald Weasley and the two boys meet Hermione Granger, whose snobbiness and affinity for spells initially causes the two boys to dislike her. There, Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first-year, Draco Malfoy, who shows prejudice against Ron for his family's financial difficulties.

Arriving at Hogwarts, the first-years are assigned by the magical Sorting Hat to Houses that best suit their personalities, the four Houses being Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw. Harry hears from Ron about Slytherin's dark reputation which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, and thus objects to being sorted into Slytherin despite the Hat claiming that Harry has potential to develop under that House. He winds up in Gryffindor with Ron and Hermione, while Draco is sorted into Slytherin like his family before him.

As classes begin at Hogwarts, Harry discovers his innate talent for flying on broomsticks despite no prior experience, and is recruited into his House's team for Quidditch (a competitive wizards' sport sharing similarities to football, but played on flying broomsticks) as a Seeker. He also comes to dislike the school's Potions master, Severus Snape, who is also the Head of Slytherin House who acts with bias in favour of members of his House while perpetually looking for opportunities to fail Harry and his friends. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into a duel in the trophy room to get them out of their rooms at night and secretly tells Filch, the school's caretaker, where they will be. Hermione unintentionally is forced to come along after her failed attempts to stop them, and they find Gryffindor student Neville Longbottom asleep outside the common area because he had forgotten the password to get in. After realizing the duel was a set-up to get them in trouble, they run away. They then discover a huge three-headed dog standing guard over a trapdoor in a forbidden corridor. The school's Halloween celebrations are interrupted by the entrance of a troll into the school, which enters the girls' bathroom where Hermione was. However, she is saved by Harry and Ron and, as a result, Hermione is grateful and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury as well as behaviour, the recent events prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to suspect him to be looking for a way to enter the trapdoor.

Hermione forbids the boys from investigating for fear of expulsion, and instead makes Harry direct his attention to his first ever Quidditch game, where his broomstick begins to lose control and threatens to throw him off. This leads Hermione to suspect that Snape had jinxed Harry's broom, due to his strange behaviour during the match. After the excitement of winning the match has died down, Christmas arrives and Harry receives an invisibility cloak from an anonymous source claiming that the cloak belonged to Harry's father. Using the cloak to explore the school at night to investigate what is under the trapdoor, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, in which the viewer sees his or her deepest desires come true.

A visit to Hagrid's hut at the foot of the school leads the trio to find a newspaper report stating there had been an attempted robbery of a Gringotts vault—the same vault that Hagrid and Harry had visited when the latter was getting his school supplies. A further indiscretion from Hagrid allows them to work out that the object kept under that trapdoor is a Philosopher's Stone, which grants its user immortality as well as the ability to turn any metal into pure gold. Harry is also informed by a centaur named Firenze in the forest that a plot to steal the Stone is being orchestrated by none other than Voldemort himself, who schemes to use it to be restored back to his body and return to power. When the school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione and Ron fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor themselves.

They encounter a series of obstacles, each of which requires unique skills possessed by one of the three, one of which requires Ron to sacrifice himself in a life-sized game of wizard's chess. In the final room, Harry, now alone, finds Quirinus Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, who reveals he had been the one working behind the scenes to kill Harry by first jinxing his broom and then letting a troll into the school, while Snape had been trying to protect Harry instead. Quirrell is helping Voldemort, whose face has sprouted on the back of Quirrell's head but is constantly concealed by his oversized turban, to attain the Philosopher's Stone so as to restore his body. Quirrell uses Harry to get past the final obstacle, the Mirror of Erised, by forcing him to stand before the Mirror. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the Stone and surreptitiously deposits it into his pocket. As Quirrell attempts to seize the stone and kill Harry, his flesh burns on contact with the boy's skin and breaks into blisters. Harry's scar suddenly burns with pain and he passes out.

Three days later, he awakens in the school's infirmary, where Dumbledore explains his survival against Voldemort is due to his mother's sacrificing her life in order for him to live. This left a powerful protective charm on Harry that lives in his blood, which caused Quirrell's hands to burn on contact with Harry due to him being possessed by hatred and greed. He also reveals himself as the one who sent Harry his father's invisibility cloak, while Quirrell has been left to die by Voldemort, who still lives, and the Stone has now been destroyed. The eventful school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to Privet Drive for the summer, neglecting to tell the Dursleys that the use of spells is forbidden by under-aged wizards and witches and thus anticipating some fun and peace over the holidays.

Could you survive on your own, in the wild, with everyone out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?

In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before - and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.

New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Collins delivers equal parts suspense and philosophy, adventure and romance, in this searing novel set in a future with unsettling parallels to our present.
#
In the nation of Panem, established in the remains of North America after an unspecified apocalyptic event, the wealthy Capitol exploits the twelve surrounding districts for their natural resources and labour.[5] District 12 is in the coal-rich region that was once Appalachia, while the Capitol is in the Rocky Mountains.[6] As punishment for a past failed rebellion against the Capitol, which resulted in the obliteration of District 13, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the 12 remaining districts are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, a contest in which the "tributes" must fight to the death in an outdoor arena until only one remains.

The story is narrated by 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen from District 12, who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games in place of her 12-year-old sister, Primrose. The male tribute is Peeta Mellark, a former schoolmate of Katniss who once gave her bread from his family's bakery when her family was starving. In the days leading up to the Games in the Capitol, they are given advice by their drunken mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; chaperone Effie Trinket; and various stylists to enhance their public perception to get potential sponsors, who will send potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. Katniss's stylist, Cinna, designed special costumes for Katniss and Peeta that set them apart from the tributes when introduced to the public. During their evaluation by the Gamemakers, Katniss unexpectedly gets the highest score among the others. Meanwhile, Rue, the petite 12-year-old girl tribute from District 11, follows Katniss and Peeta around during the training sessions. On the day before the games, in the televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta reveals his long-unrequited love for Katniss; she is initially shocked by this and believes this is a ploy to gain sponsors, but later accepts this as sincere. Haymitch then promotes their image as "star-crossed lovers".

The Games begin, and nearly half the tributes are killed in the bloodbath at the start, fighting over the weapons and supplies throughout the arena. Katniss disregards Haymitch's earlier advice to flee immediately and nearly dies, but uses her well-practiced hunting and survival skills to hide in the woods. After a few days, an artificial fire drives Katniss toward the others. She is spotted and treed by the "Careers" tributes and Peeta, who seems to have allied with them. Rue, hiding in a nearby tree, silently alerts Katniss to a "tracker jacker" nest, which she sends it plummeting down, releasing the flying insects. Their venom kills one of the careers and drives the others away, but Katniss is stung and begins hallucinating. Peeta returns, but instead of killing her, tells her to run away. Katniss later forms an alliance with Rue, but Rue is fatally wounded by another tribute while Katniss destroys the careers' supplies. Katniss kills Rue's killer with an arrow, and accompanies Rue as she dies and spreads flowers over the body to show her defiance against the Capitol. In gratitude, Rue's district sends Katniss a loaf of bread.

A rule change is announced, allowing the tributes from the same district to win as a pair. Katniss finds and nurses a wounded Peeta (who later revealed that he formed an alliance with the careers to protect Katniss), acting the part of a girl in love to gain gifts. When the Gamemakers send a delivery of what each contestant needs most, Katniss risks her life to obtain medicine for Peeta. She is intercepted by a career tribute Clove, who gloats over Rue's death and tries to kill Katniss, but is killed by Thresh, the male District 11 tribute, who spares Katniss for Rue's sake. The medicine saves Peeta's life, and they both spend time hunting and collecting food.

Katniss and Peeta become the last two survivors, but the Gamemakers revoke the rule change to force one to kill the other for a dramatic finale. In defiance, Katniss prepares to consume the poisonous "nightlock" berries with Peeta. Realizing they intend to commit suicide so that there will not be a victor for the games, the Gamemakers declare Katniss and Peeta the victors. Although both of them receive a hero's welcome as a couple, Katniss is warned by Haymitch that the Capitol may take action against her for her defiance. Along the way back to District 12, Peeta is heartbroken to learn that Katniss' actions were part of a calculated ploy to gain sympathy. Katniss, however, is unsure of her own feelings and her future.

In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.

During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.
#
In post-apocalyptic Chicago (though this is not revealed until Allegiant), survivors are divided into five factions: Abnegation, the selfless; Amity, the peaceful; Candor, the honest; Dauntless, the brave; and Erudite, the intelligent. All sixteen-year-olds are tested to determine which faction they are best suited for, but select their own faction at the Choosing Ceremony. Those who do not complete initiation become "factionless,” living on the streets.

Sixteen-year-old Beatrice Prior feels she does not belong in her Abnegation family. Her inconclusive test results (Abnegation, Dauntless and Erudite) mark her as “Divergent,” and the test administrator Tori warns her never to tell anyone. Agonizing over her future, Beatrice decides to leave Abnegation and join Dauntless. Her brother Caleb chooses Erudite.

The new Dauntless initiates jump onto a moving train to Dauntless headquarters, and are instructed to jump onto the roof. Most make it, but one initiate falls to her death, and another is too afraid to jump. They are then ordered to jump into the compound entrance; Beatrice jumps first. Reaching the bottom, she tells the instructor Four that her name is Tris.

Four explains that, unlike the other factions, who accept all successful initiates, only the top ten Dauntless initiates will stay while the rest become Factionless. Tris befriends several fellow initiates like Christina, Will and Al, but comes into conflict with others like Peter, Drew and Molly.


In the first stage of initiation, they are trained in guns, knives and hand-to-hand combat. Despite her lack of physical strength, Tris finishes in sixth place. A relationship emerges between Tris and Four, and Tris is pummeled by Peter in a fight. After the Stage 1 rankings are announced, the second-place Peter stabs first-place Edward in the eye. Edward leaves to become Factionless, followed by his girlfriend Myra. This allows Peter to take Edward's place as the first-place initiate.

On Visiting Day, Tris’ mother tells Tris to stay strong but to not bring too much attention to herself during training.

Erudite stirs dissent against the city's Abnegation leadership and accuses their leader Marcus of abusing his son. The rumors are fueled by the fact that Marcus' son, as well as Tris and Caleb, all left Abnegation, which is also alleged to be hoarding supplies.

The initiates enter Stage 2, facing hallucinations based on their deepest fears. Tris' Divergent abilities give her an advantage and earn her the top rank. Peter, Drew, and Al attack Tris, threatening sexual assault and nearly throwing her to her death, but Four intervenes. Al begs Tris’ forgiveness, but she rejects him; he later commits suicide.

The final stage gathers the initiates’ fears into a simulated “fear landscape,” testing their acquired skills. Tris and Four grow closer, and he lets her into his own fear landscape; she discovers he has only four fears, hence his nickname. In Four's final fear, Tris also learns that he is Marcus' son Tobias, and the claims of abuse were true. Four uncovers Erudite's plans to use Dauntless to stage an attack on Abnegation.

Tris overcomes her fear landscape, and the Dauntless initiates are injected with a "tracking" serum. Tris shares her feelings for Tobias, and is ranked first at the initiation ceremony.


The serum transforms the Dauntless into hypnotized soldiers to attack Abnegation. Tris and Tobias' Divergent abilities allow them to remain unaffected by the serum and escape to the Abnegation compound. Tris is shot and they are captured. Erudite leader Jeanine Matthews, mastermind of the attack, injects Tobias with an experimental serum that overrides his Divergence. Under Jeanine's control, Tobias oversees the attack from the Dauntless control room. Tris is almost drowned in a tank, but is rescued by her mother, who reveals she is also Divergent before she is killed whilst helping Tris escape. Tris is forced to kill Will, who attacks her under the influence of the simulation.

She finds her and Tobias' fathers, explaining the truth behind the attack. They fight their way to Dauntless headquarters, where Tris' father sacrifices himself. Tris is attacked by the mind-controlled Tobias; unable to kill him, Tris surrenders, causing Tobias to break free of the serum's control. They shut down the Erudite simulation and free the Dauntless. They rejoin the initiates, and board a train to the Amity sector to find the Abnegation survivors.
