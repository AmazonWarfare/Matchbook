{"genre": ["Fantasy"], "text": ["\ness of kindness, get command of ten thousand Lifeless? It\u2019s obviously a dire error in judgment. Particularly since I don\u2019t have command of any troops.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlushweaver,\u201d he said with amusement, \u201cyou\u2019re the goddess of honesty, communication, and interpersonal relationships. Why in the world would you be given stewardship of armies?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are many interpersonal relationships related to armies,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all, what do you call one man hitting another with a sword? That\u2019s interpersonal.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d Lightsong said, glancing back at Mercystar\u2019s pavilion.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Blushweaver said, \u201cI should think that you\u2019d appreciate my arguments, since relationships are, in fact, war. As is clear in our relationship, dear Lightsong. We . . .\u201d She trailed off, then poked him in the shoulder. \u201cLightsong? Pay attention to me!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\nShe folded her arms petulantly. \u201cI must say, your banter has been decidedly off today. I may just have to find someone else to play with.\u201d\n\n\u201cHum, yes,\u201d he said, studying Mercystar\u2019s palace. \u201cTragic. Now, the break-in at Mercystar\u2019s. It was just one person?\u201d\n\n\u201cSupposedly,\u201d Blushweaver said. \u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d \u201cWas anyone injured?\u201d\n\n\u201cA couple of servants,\u201d Blushweaver said with a wave of the hand. \u201cOne was found dead, I believe. You should be paying attention to me, not that\u2014\u201d\n\nLightsong froze. \u201cSomeone was killed?\u201d\n\nShe shrugged. \u201cSo they say.\u201d\n\nHe turned around. \u201cI\u2019m going to go back and talk to her some more.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Blushweaver snapped. \u201cBut you\u2019ll do it without me. I have gardens to enjoy.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d Lightsong said, already turning away. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d\n\nBlushweaver let out a huff of indignation, her hands on her hips, watching him go. Lightsong ignored her irritation, however, more focused on . . .\n\nWhat? So some servants had been hurt. It wasn\u2019t his place to be involved in criminal disturbances. And yet, he walked straight to Mercystar\u2019s pavilion again, his servants and priests trailing behind, as ever.\nShe was still reclining on her couch. \u201cLightsong?\u201d she asked with a frown.\n\n\u201cI returned because I just heard that one of your servants was killed in the attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe poor man. What a terrible occurrence. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s found his blessings in heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny, how they\u2019re always in the last place you consider looking,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cTell me, how did the murder happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very odd, actually,\u201d she said. \u201cThe two guards at the door were knocked unconscious. The intruder was discovered by four of my servants who were walking through the ser vice hallway. He fought them, knocked out one, killed another, and two escaped.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow was the man killed?\u201d\n\nMercystar sighed. \u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d she said with a wave of the hand. \u201cMy priests can tell you. I fear I was too traumatized to take in the details.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be all right if I talked to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you must,\u201d Mercystar said. \u201cHave I mentioned exactly how thoroughly out of sorts I am? One would think that you\u2019d prefer to stay and comfort me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Mercystar,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you know anything of me, then you will realize that leaving you alone is by far the best comfort I can offer.\u201d\n\nShe frowned, looking up.\n\n\u201cIt was a joke, my dear,\u201d he said. \u201cI am, unfortunately, quite bad at them. Scoot, you coming?\u201d Llarimar, who stood\u2014as always\u2014with the rest of the priests, looked toward him. \u201cYour Grace?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo need to upset the others any further,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cI think that you and I alone will be sufficient for this exercise.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you command, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. Once again, Lightsong\u2019s servants found themselves separated from their god. They clustered uncertainly on the grass\u2014like a group of children abandoned by their parents.\n\n\u201cWhat is this about, Your Grace?\u201d Llarimar asked quietly as they walked up to the palace.\n\n\u201cI honestly have no idea,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cI just feel that there\u2019s something odd going on here. The break-in. The death of that man. Something is wrong.\u201d\n\nLlarimar looked at him, a strange expression on his face.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lightsong asked.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar finally said. \u201cThis is just a very uncharacteristic of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Lightsong said, feeling confident about the decision nonetheless. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t say what prompted it. Curiosity, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cCuriosity that outweighs your desire to avoid doing . . . well, anything at all?\u201d\n\nLightsong shrugged. He felt energized as he walked into the palace. His normal lethargy retreated, and instead he felt excitement. It was almost familiar. He found a group of priests chatting inside the servants\u2019 corridor. Lightsong walked right up to them, and they turned to regard him with shock.\n\n\u201cAh, good,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cI assume you can tell me more of this break-in?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d one said as all three bowed their heads. \u201cI assure you, we have everything under control. There is no danger to you or your people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Lightsong said, looking over the corridor. \u201cIs this where the man was killed, then?\u201d\n\nThey glanced at one another. \u201cOver there,\u201d one of them said reluctantly, pointing to a turn in the hallway.\n\n\u201cWonderful. Accompany me, if you please.\u201d Lightsong walked up to the indicated section. A group of workers were removing the boards from the floor, probably to be replaced. Bloodstained wood, no matter how well cleaned, would not do for a goddess\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cLooks messy. How did it happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t sure, Your Grace,\u201d said one of the priests. \u201cThe intruder knocked the men at the doorway unconscious, but did not otherwise harm them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Mercystar mentioned that,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cBut then he fought with four of the servants?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, \u2018fought\u2019 isn\u2019t quite the right word,\u201d the priest said, sighing. Though Lightsong wasn\u2019t their god, he was a god. They were bound by oath to answer his questions.\n\n\u201cHe immobilized one of them with an Awakened rope,\u201d the priest continued. \u201cThen, while one remained behind to delay the intruder, the other two ran for aid. The intruder quickly knocked the remaining man unconscious. At that time, the one who had been tied up was still alive.\u201d The priest glanced at his colleagues. \u201cWhen help finally came\u2014delayed by a Lifeless animal that was causing confusion\u2014they found the second man still unconscious. The first, still tied up, was dead. Stabbed through the heart with a dueling blade.\u201d\n\nLightsong nodded, kneeling beside the broken boards. The servants who had been working there bowed their heads and retreated. He wasn\u2019t certain what he expected to find. The floor had been scrubbed clean, then torn apart. However, there was a strange patch a short distance away. He walked over and knelt, inspecting it more closely. Completely devoid of color, he thought. He looked up, focusing on the priests. \u201cAn Awakener, you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, Your Grace.\u201d\n\nHe looked back down at the grey patch. There\u2019s no chance an Idrian did this, he realized.Not if he used Awakening. \u201cWhat was this Lifeless creature you mentioned?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Lifeless squirrel, Your Grace,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cThe intruder used it as a diversion.\u201d \u201cWell made?\u201d he asked.\nThey nodded. \u201cUsing modern Command words, if its actions were any judge,\u201d one said. \u201cIt even had ichor-alcohol instead of blood. Took us the better part of the night to catch the thing!\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d Lightsong said, standing. \u201cBut the intruder escaped?\u201d \u201cYes, Your Grace,\u201d one of them said. \u201cWhat do you suppose he was after?\u201d\n\nThe priests wavered. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure, Your Grace,\u201d one of them said. \u201cWe scared him away before he could reach his goal\u2014one of our men saw him fleeing back out the way he had come. Perhaps the resistance was too much for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think that he may have been a common burglar, Your Grace,\u201d one said. \u201cHere to sneak into the gallery and steal the art.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds likely enough to me,\u201d Lightsong said, standing. \u201cGood work with this, and all that.\u201d He turned, walking back down the hallway toward the entrance. He felt strangely surreal.\n\nThe priests were lying to him.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know how he could tell. Yet he did\u2014he knew it deep inside, with some instincts he hadn\u2019t realized he possessed. Instead of disturbing him, for some reason the lies excited him.\n\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Llarimar said, hurrying up. \u201cDid you find what you wanted?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was no Idrian who broke in,\u201d Lightsong said quietly as they walked into the sunlight.\n\nLlarimar raised an eyebrow. \u201cThere have been cases of Idrians coming to Hallandren and buying themselves Breath, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd have you ever heard of one using a Lifeless?\u201d Llarimar fell quiet. \u201cNo, Your Grace,\u201d he finally admitted.\n\n\u201cIdrians hate Lifeless. Consider them abominations, or some such nonsense. Either way, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for an Idrian to try and get in like that. What would be the point? Assassinating a single one of the Returned? He or she would only be replaced, and the protocols in place would be certain that even the Lifeless armies weren\u2019t without someone to direct them for long. The possibility for retaliation would far outweigh the benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you believe that it was a thief?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cA \u2018common burglar\u2019 with enough money or Breath that he\n\ncan waste a Lifeless, just for a diversion? Whoever broke in, he was already rich. Besides, why sneak through the servants\u2019 hallway? There are no valuables there. The interior of the palace holds far more wealth.\u201d\n\nLlarimar fell quiet again. He looked over at Lightsong, the same curious expression as before on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s some very solid reasoning, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cI feel positively unlike myself. Perhaps I need to go get drunk.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get drunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, but I certainly enjoy trying.\u201d\n\nThey walked back toward his palace, picking up his servants on the way. Llarimar seemed unsettled. Lightsong, however, simply felt excited. Murder in the Court of Gods, he thought.True, it was only a servant\u2014but I\u2019m supposed to be a god for all people, not just important ones. I wonder how long it\u2019s been since someone was killed in the court? Hasn\u2019t happened in my lifetime, certainly.\n\nMercystar\u2019s priests were hiding something. Why had the intruder released a diversion\u2014particularly such an expensive one\u2014if he were simply going to run away? The servants of the Returned were not formidable soldiers or warriors. So why had he given up so easily?\n\nAll good questions. Good questions that he, of all people, shouldn\u2019t have bothered to wonder about.\n\nAnd yet, he did.\n\nAll the way back to the palace, through a nice meal, and even into the night.\n\nSiri\u2019s servants clustered around her uncertainly as she walked into the chaotic room. She wore a blue and white gown with a ten-foot train. As she entered, scribes and priests looked up in shock; some immediately scrambled to their feet, bowing. Others just stared as she passed, her serving women doing their best to hold her train with dignity.\n\nDetermined, Siri continued through the chamber\u2014which was more like a hallway than a proper room. Long tables lined the walls, stacks of paper cluttered those tables, and scribes\u2014Pahn Kahl men in brown, Hallandren men in the day\u2019s colors\u2014worked on the papers. The walls were, of course, black. Colored rooms were only found in the center of the palace, where the God King and Siri spent most of their time. Separately, of course.\n\nThough, things are a little different at night, she thought, smiling. It felt very conspiratorial of her to be teaching him letters. She had a secret that she was keeping from the rest of the kingdom, a secret that involved one of the most powerful men in the entire world. That gave her a thrill. She supposed she should have been more worried. Indeed, in her more thoughtful moments, the reality behind Bluefingers\u2019s warnings did worry her. That\u2019s why she had come to the scribes\u2019 quarters.\n\nI wonder why the bedchamber is out here, she thought. Outside the main body of the palace, in the black part.\n\nEither way, the servants\u2019 section of the palace\u2014God King\u2019s bedchamber excluded\u2014was the last place the scribes expected to be disturbed by their queen. Siri noticed that some of her serving women looked apologetically at the men in the room as Siri arrived at the doors on the far side. A servant opened the door for her, and she entered the room beyond.\n\nA relaxed group of priests stood leafing through books in the medium-sized chamber. They looked over at her. One dropped his book to the floor in shock.\n\n\u201cI,\u201d Siri proclaimed, \u201cwant some books!\u201d\n\nThe priests stared at her. \u201cBooks?\u201d one finally asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Siri said, hands on hips. \u201cThis is the palace library, is it not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, Vessel,\u201d the priest said, glancing at his companions. All wore the robes of their office, and this day\u2019s colors were violet and silver.\n\n\u201cWell, then,\u201d Siri said. \u201cI\u2019d like to borrow some of the books. I am tired of common entertainment and shall be reading to myself in my spare time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely you don\u2019t want these books, Vessel,\u201d another priest said. \u201cThey are about boring topics like religion or city finances. Surely a book of stories would be more appropriate.\u201d\n\nSiri raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd where might I find such a \u2018more appropriate\u2019 volume?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could have a reader bring the book from the city collection,\u201d the priest said, stepping forward smoothly. \u201cHe\u2019d be here shortly.\u201d\n\nSiri hesitated. \u201cNo. I do not like that option. I shall take some of these books here.\u201d \u201cNo, you shall not,\u201d a new voice said from behind.\n\nSiri turned. Treledees, high priest of the God King, stood behind her, fingers laced, miter on his head, frown on his face.\n\n\u201cYou cannot refuse me,\u201d Siri said. \u201cI am your queen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can and will refuse you, Vessel,\u201d Treledees said. \u201cYou see, these books are quite valuable, and should something happen to them, the kingdom would suffer grave consequences. Even our priests are not allowed to bear them out of the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat could happen to them in the palace, of all places?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\u201cIt is the principle, Vessel. These are the property of a god. Susebron has made it clear that he wishes the books to stay here.\u201d\n\nOh he has, has he? For Treledees and the priests, having a tongueless god was very convenient. The priests could claim that he\u2019d told them whatever served the purposes of the moment, and he could never correct them.\n\n\u201cIf you absolutely must read these volumes,\u201d Treledees said, \u201cyou can stay here to do it.\u201d\n\nShe glanced at the room and thought of the stuffy priests standing in a flock around her, listening to her sound out words, making a fool of herself. If anything in these volumes was sensitive, they\u2019d probably find a way to distract her and keep her from finding it.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Siri said, retreating from the crowded room. \u201cPerhaps another time.\u201d\n\n\n\nI told you that they would not let you have the books, the God King wrote.\n\nSiri rolled her eyes and flopped back onto the bed. She still wore her heavy evening dress. For some reason, being able to communicate with the God King made her even shyer. She only took off the dresses right before she went to sleep\u2014which, lately, was getting later and later. Susebron sat in his\nusual place\u2014not on the mattress, as he had that first night. Instead, he had pulled his chair up beside the bed. He still seemed so large and imposing. At least, he did until he looked at her, his face open, honest. He waved her back toward him where he sat with a board, writing with a bit of charcoal that she\u2019d smuggled in.\n\nYou shud not anger the prests so, he wrote. His spelling, as one might expect, was awful.\n\nPriests. She had pilfered a cup, then had hidden it in the room. If she held it to the wall and listened, she could sometimes faintly hear talking on the other side. After her nightly moaning and bouncing, she could usually hear chairs moving and a door closing. After that, there was silence in the other room.\n\nEither the priests left each night once they were sure the deed was done or they were suspicious and trying to fool her into thinking they were gone. Her instinct said the former, though she made certain to whisper when she spoke to the God King, just in case.\n\nSiri? he wrote. What are you thinking about?\n\n\u201cYour priests,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThey frustrate me! They intentionally do things to spite me.\u201d\n\nThey are good men, he wrote. They work very hard to mayntayn my kingdom.\n\n\u201cThey cut out your tongue,\u201d she said.\n\nThe God King sat quietly for a few moments. It was nesisary, he wrote. I have too much power.\n\nShe moved over. As usual, he shied back when she approached, moving his arm out of the way. There was no arrogance in this reaction. She had begun to think that he just had very little experience with touching.\n\n\u201cSusebron,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThese men are not looking after your best interests. They did more than cut out your tongue. They speak in your name, doing whatever they please.\u201d\n\nThey are not my enemes, he wrote stubbornly. They are good men.\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d she said. \u201cThen why do you hide from them the fact that you\u2019re learning to read?\u201d He paused again, glancing downward.\n\nSo much humility for one who has ruled Hallandren for fifty years, she thought. In many ways, he\u2019s like a child.\n\nI do not want them to know, he finally wrote. I do not want to upset them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Siri said flatly.\n\nHe paused. You are shur? he wrote. Does that mean you beleve me?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Siri said. \u201cThat was sarcasm, Susebron.\u201d\n\nHe frowned. I do not know this thing. Sarkazm.\n\n\u201cSarcasm,\u201d she said, spelling it. \u201cIt\u2019s . . .\u201d She trailed off. \u201cIt\u2019s when you say one thing, but you really mean the opposite.\u201d\nHe frowned at her, then furiously erased his board and began writing again. This thing makes no sense. Why not say what you mean?\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Siri said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like . . . oh, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a way to be clever when you make fun of people.\u201d\n\nMake fun of people? he wrote.\n\nGod of Colors! Siri thought, trying to think of how to explain. It seemed ridiculous to her that he would know nothing of mockery. And yet, he had lived his entire life as a revered deity and monarch. \u201cMockery is when you say things to tease,\u201d Siri said. \u201cThings that might be hurtful to someone if said in anger, but you say them in an affectionate or in a playful way. Sometimes you do just say them to be mean. Sarcasm is one of the ways we mock\u2014we say the opposite, but in an exaggerated way.\u201d\n\nHow do you know if the person is affekshonate, playful, or mean?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Siri said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way they say it, I guess.\u201d\n\nThe God King sat, looking confused but thoughtful. You are very normal, he finally wrote. Siri frowned. \u201cUm. Thank you?\u201d\n\nWas that good sarcasm? he wrote. Because in reality, you are quite strange.\n\nShe smiled. \u201cI try my best.\u201d\n\nHe looked up.\n\n\u201cThat was sarcasm again,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t \u2018try\u2019 to be strange. It just happens.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her. How had she ever been frightened of this man? How had she misunderstood? The look in his eyes, it wasn\u2019t arrogance or emotionlessness. It was the look of a man who was trying very hard to understand the world around him. It was innocence. Earnestness.\n\nHowever, he was not simple. The speed at which he\u2019d learned to write proved that. True, he\u2019d already understood the spoken version of the language\u2014and he\u2019d memorized all of the letters in the book years before meeting her. She\u2019d only needed to explain the rules of spelling and sound for him to make the final jump.\n\nShe still found it amazing how quickly he picked things up. She smiled at him, and he hesitantly smiled back.\n\n\u201cWhy do you say that I\u2019m strange?\u201d she asked.\n\nYou do not do things like other people, he wrote. Everyone else bows before me all of the time. Nobody talks to me. Even the prests, they only okashonally give me instrukshons\u2014and they haven\u2019t done that in years.\n\n\u201cDoes it offend you that I don\u2019t bow, and that I talk to you like a friend?\u201d\n\nHe erased his board. Offend me? Why would it offend me? Do you do it in sarcasm?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI really like talking to you.\u201d\nThen I do not understand.\n\n\u201cEveryone else is afraid of you,\u201d Siri said. \u201cBecause of how powerful you are.\u201d\n\nBut they took away my tongue to make me safe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your Breath that scares them,\u201d Siri said. \u201cIt\u2019s your power over armies and people. You\u2019re the God King. You could order anyone in the kingdom killed.\u201d\n\nBut why would I do that? he wrote. I would not kill a good person. They must know that.\n\nSiri sat back, resting on the plush bed, the fire crackling in the hearth behind them. \u201cI know that, now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut nobody else does. They don\u2019t know you\u2014they know only how powerful you are. So they fear you. And so they show their respect for you.\u201d\n\nHe paused. And so, you do not respect me?\n\n\u201cOf course I do,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cI\u2019ve just never been very good at following rules. In fact, if someone tells me what to do, I usually want to do the opposite.\u201d\n\nThat is very strange, he wrote. I thought all people did what they were told.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll find that most do not,\u201d she said, smiling.\n\nThat will get you into trouble.\n\n\u201cIs that what the priests taught you?\u201d\n\nHe shook his head; then he reached over and took out his book. The book of stories for children. He brought it with him always, and she could see from his reverent touch that he valued it greatly.\n\nIt\u2019s probably his only real possession, she thought. Everything else is taken from him every day, then replaced the next morning.\n\nThis book, he wrote. My mother read the stories to me when I was a child. I memorized them all, before she was taken away. It speaks of many children who do not do as they are told. They are often eaten by monsters.\n\n\u201cOh are they?\u201d Siri said, smiling.\n\nDo not be afraid, he wrote. My mother taught me that the monsters are not real. But I remember the lessons the stories taught. Obediance is good. You shud treat people well. Do not go into the jungle by yourself. Do not lie. Do not hurt others.\n\nSiri\u2019s smile deepened. Everything he\u2019d learned in his life, he\u2019d either gotten from moralistic folktales or from priests who were teaching him to be a figurehead. Once she realized that, the simple, honest man that he had become was not so difficult to understand.\n\nYet what had prompted him to defy that learning and ask her to teach him? Why was he willing to keep his learning secret from the men he had been taught all his life to obey and trust? He was not quite so innocent as he appeared.\n\u201cThese stories,\u201d she said. \u201cYour desire to treat people well. Is that what kept you from . . . taking me on any of those nights when I first came into the room?\u201d\n\nFrom taking you? I do not understand.\n\nSiri blushed, hair turning red to match. \u201cI mean, why did you just sit there?\u201d\n\nBecause I did not know what else to do, he said. I knew that we need to have a child. So I sat and waited for it to happen. We must be doing something wrong, for no child has come.\n\nSiri paused, then blinked. He couldn\u2019t possibly . . . \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to have children?\u201d\n\nIn the stories, he wrote, a man and a woman spend the night together. Then they have a child. We spent many nights together, and there were no children.\n\n\u201cAnd nobody\u2014none of your priests\u2014explained the process to you?\u201d No. What process do you mean?\n\nShe sat for a moment. No, she thought, feeling her blush deepen. I am not going to have that conversation with him. \u201cI think we\u2019ll talk about it another time.\u201d\n\nIt was a very strange experiance when you came into the room that first night, he wrote. I must admit, I was very scared of you.\n\nSiri smiled as she remembered her own terror. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to her that he would be frightened. Why would it have? He was the God King.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said, tapping the bedspread with one finger, \u201cyou were never taken to other women?\u201d No, he wrote. I did find it very interesting to see you naked.\n\nShe flushed again, though her hair had apparently decided to just stay red. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to know about other women. No mistresses? No concubines?\u201d\n\nNo.\n\n\u201cThey really are scared of you having a child.\u201d\n\nWhy say that? he wrote. They sent you to me.\n\n\u201cOnly after fifty years of rule,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd only under very controlled circumstances, with the proper lineage to produce a child with the right bloodline. Bluefingers thinks that child might be a danger to us.\u201d\n\nI do not understand why, he wrote. This is what everyone wants. There must be an heir.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Siri said. \u201cYou still look like you\u2019re barely two decades old. Your aging is slowed by your BioChroma.\u201d\n\nWithout an heir, the kingdom is in danger. Should I be killed, there will be nobody to rule. \u201cAnd that wasn\u2019t a danger for the last fifty years?\u201d\nHe paused, frowning, then slowly erased his board.\n\n\u201cThey must think that you\u2019re in danger now,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cBut not from sickness\u2014even I know that Returned don\u2019t suffer from diseases. In fact, do they even age at all?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think so, the God King wrote.\n\n\u201cHow did the previous God Kings die?\u201d\n\nThere have been only four, he wrote. I do not know how they died for certain.\n\n\u201cOnly four kings in several hundred years, all dead of mysterious circumstances. . . .\u201d\n\nMy father died before I was old enough to remember him, Susebron wrote. I was told he gave his life for the kingdom\u2014that he released his BioChromatic Breath, as all Returned can, to cure a terrible disease. The other Returned can only cure one person. A God King, however, can cure many. That is what I was told.\n\n\u201cThere must be a record of that then,\u201d she said. \u201cSomewhere in those books the priests have guarded so tightly.\u201d\n\nI am sorry that they would not let you read them, he wrote.\n\nShe waved an indifferent hand. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much chance of it working. I\u2019ll need to find another way to get at those histories.\u201d Having a child is the danger, she thought. That\u2019s what Bluefingers said. So whatever threat there is to my life, it will only come after there is an heir. Bluefingers mentioned a threat to the God King too. That almost makes it sound like the danger comes from the priests themselves. Why would they want to harm their own god?\n\nShe glanced at Susebron, who was flipping intently through his book of stories. She smiled at the look of concentration on his face as he deciphered the text.\n\nWell, she thought, considering what he knows of sex, I\u2019d say that we don\u2019t have to worry much about having a child in the near future.\n\nOf course, she was also worried that the lack of a child would prove just as dangerous as the presence of one.\n\nVivenna went among the people of T\u2019Telir and couldn\u2019t help feeling that every one of them recognized her.\n\nShe fought the feeling down. It was actually a miracle that Thame\u2014who came from her own home city \u2014had been able to pick her out. The people around her would have no way of connecting Vivenna to the rumors they might have heard, especially considering her clothing.\n\nImmodest reds and yellows layered one atop the other on her dress. The garment had been the only one that Parlin and Tonk Fah had been able to find that met her stringent requirements for modesty. The tubelike dress was made after a foreign cut, from Tedradel, across the Inner Sea. It came down almost to her ankles, and though its snugness emphasized her bust, at least the garment covered her almost up to the neck, and had full-length sleeves.\nRebelliously, she did find herself stealing glances at the other women in their loose, short skirts and sleeveless tops. That much exposed skin was scandalous, but with the blazing sun and the cursed coastal humidity, she could see why they did it.\n\nAfter a month in the city, she was also beginning to get the hang of moving with the flow of traffic. She still wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to be out, but Denth had been persuasive.\n\nYou know the worst thing that can happen to a bodyguard? he had asked. Letting your charge get killed when you aren\u2019t even there. We have a small team, Princess. We can either divide and leave you behind with one guard or you can come with us. Personally, I\u2019d like to have you along where I can keep an eye on you.\n\nAnd so she\u2019d come. Dressed in one of her new gowns, her hair turned an uncomfortable\u2014yet un-Idrian \u2014yellow and left loose, blowing behind her. She walked around the garden square, as if out on a stroll, moving so that she wouldn\u2019t look nervous. The people of T\u2019Telir liked gardens\u2014they had all kinds all over the city. In fact, from what Vivenna had seen, most of the city practically was a garden. Palms and ferns grew on every street, and exotic flowers bloomed everywhere year-round.\n\nFour streets crossed in the square, with four plots of cultivated ground forming a checkerboard pattern. Each sprouted a dozen different palms. The buildings surrounding the gardens were more rich than the ones in the market up the way. And while there was plenty of foot traffic, people made certain to stick to the slate sidewalks, for carriages were common. This was a wealthy shopping district. No tents. Fewer performers. Higher quality\u2014and more expensive\u2014shops.\n\nVivenna strolled along the perimeter of the northwestern garden block. There were ferns and grass to her right. Shops of a quaint, rich, and\u2014of course\u2014colorful variety lay across the street to her left. Tonk Fah and Parlin lounged between two of these. Parlin had the monkey on his shoulder, and had taken to wearing a colorful red vest with his green hat. She couldn\u2019t help thinking that the woodsman was even more out of place in T\u2019Telir than she was, but he didn\u2019t seem to attract any attention.\n\nVivenna kept walking. Jewels trailed her somewhere in the crowd. The woman was good\u2014Vivenna only rarely caught a glimpse of her, and that was because she\u2019d been told where to look. She never saw Denth. He was there somewhere, far too stealthy for her to spot. As she reached the end of the street and turned around to walk back, she did catch sight of Clod. The Lifeless stood as still as one of the D\u2019Denir statues that lined the gardens, impassively watching the crowds pass. Most of the people ignored him.\n\nDenth was right. Lifeless weren\u2019t plentiful, but they also weren\u2019t uncommon. Several walked through the market carrying packages for their owners. None of these were as muscular or as tall as Clod\u2014 Lifeless came in as many shapes and sizes as people. They were put to work guarding shops. Acting as packmen. Sweeping the walkway. All around her.\n\nShe continued to walk, and she caught a brief glimpse of Jewels in the crowd as she passed.How does she manage to look so relaxed? Vivenna thought. Each of the mercenaries looked as calm as if they were at a leisurely picnic.\nDon\u2019t think about the danger, Vivenna thought, clenching her fists. She focused on the gardens. The truth was, she was a little jealous of the T\u2019Telirites. People lounged, sitting on the grass, lying in the shade of trees, their children playing and laughing. D\u2019Denir statues stood in a solemn line, arms upraised, weapons at the ready, as if in defense of the people. Trees climbed high into the sky, spreading branches that grew strange flowerlike bundles.\n\nWide-petaled flowers bloomed in planters; some of them were actually Tears of Edgli. Austre had placed the flowers where he wanted them. To cut and bring them back, to use them to adorn a room or house, was ostentation. Yet was it ostentatious to plant them in the middle of the city, where all were free to enjoy them?\n\nShe turned away. Her BioChroma continued to sense the beauty. The density of life in one area made a sort of buzz inside her chest.\n\nNo wonder they like to live so close together, she thought, noticing how a group of flowers scaled in color, fanning toward the inside of their planter. And if you\u2019re going to live this compactly, the only way to see nature would be to bring it in.\n\n\u201cHelp! Fire!\u201d\n\nVivenna spun, as did most of the other people on the street. The building Tonk Fah and Parlin had been standing next to was burning. Vivenna didn\u2019t continue to gawk, but turned and looked toward the center of the gardens. Most of the people in the garden itself were stunned, looking toward the smoke billowing into the air.\n\nDistraction one.\n\nPeople ran to help, crossing the street, causing carriages to pull up abruptly. At that moment, Clod stepped forward\u2014surging with the crowd\u2014and swung a club at the leg of a horse. Vivenna couldn\u2019t hear the leg break, but she did see the beast scream and fall, upsetting the carriage it had been pulling. A trunk fell from the top of the vehicle, plunging to the street.\n\nThe carriage belonged to one Nanrovah, high priest of the god Stillmark. Denth\u2019s intelligence said the carriage would be carrying valuables. Even if it weren\u2019t, a high priest in danger would draw a lot of attention. The trunk hit the street. And, in a twist of good fortune, it shattered, spraying out gold coins.\n\nDistraction two.\n\nVivenna caught a glimpse of Jewels standing on the other side of the carriage. She looked at Vivenna and nodded. Time to go. As people ran toward either gold or fire, Vivenna walked away. Nearby, Denth would be raiding one of the shops with a gang of thieves. The thieves got to keep the goods. Vivenna just wanted to make certain those goods disappeared.\n\nVivenna was joined by Jewels and Parlin on the way out. She was surprised to feel how quickly her heart was thumping. Almost nothing had happened. No real danger. No threat to herself. Just a couple of \u201caccidents.\u201d\n\nBut, then, that was the idea.\n\nHours later, Denth and Tonk Fah still hadn\u2019t returned to the house. Vivenna sat quietly on their new furniture, hands in her lap. The furniture was green. Apparently, brown was not an option in T\u2019Telir.\n\n\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Vivenna asked quietly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jewels snapped, standing beside the window, looking out at the street.\n\nPatience, Vivenna told herself. It\u2019s not her fault she\u2019s so abrasive. She had her Breath stolen.\n\n\u201cShould they be back yet?\u201d Vivenna asked calmly.\n\nJewels shrugged. \u201cMaybe. Depends on if they decided to go to a safe house to let things cool down first or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. How long do you think we should wait?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as we have to,\u201d Jewels said. \u201cLook, do you think you could just not talk to me? I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d She turned back to look out the window.\n\nVivenna stiffened at the insult. Patience! she told herself. Understand her place. That\u2019s what the Five Visions teach.\n\nVivenna stood up, then walked quietly over to Jewels. Tentatively, she laid an arm on the other woman\u2019s shoulder. Jewels jumped immediately\u2014obviously, without Breath, it was harder for her to notice when people approached her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderstand?\u201d Jewels asked. \u201cUnderstand what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey took your Breath,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cThey had no right to do something so terrible.\u201d Vivenna smiled, then withdrew, walking to the stairs. Jewels started laughing. Vivenna stopped, glancing back.\n\n\u201cYou think you understand me?\u201d Jewels asked. \u201cWhat? You feel sorry for me because I\u2019m a Drab?\u201d \u201cYour parents shouldn\u2019t have done what they did.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents served our God King,\u201d Jewels said. \u201cMy Breath was given to him directly. It\u2019s a greater honor than you could possibly understand.\u201d\n\nVivenna stood still for a moment, absorbing that comment. \u201cYou believe in the Iridescent Tones?\u201d \u201cOf course I do,\u201d Jewels said. \u201cI\u2019m a Hallandren, aren\u2019t I?\u201d \u201cBut the others\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTonk Fah is from Pahn Kahl,\u201d Jewels said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know where in the Colors Denthis from. But I\u2019m from T\u2019Telir itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut surely you can\u2019t still worship those so-called gods,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cNot after what was done to you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was done to me? I\u2019ll have you know that I gave away my Breath willingly.\u201d \u201cYou were a child!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was eleven and my parents gave me the choice. I made the right one. My father had been in the dye industry, but had slipped and fallen. The damage to his back wouldn\u2019t allow him to work, and I had five brothers and sisters. Do you know what it\u2019s like to watch your brothers and sisters starve? Years before, my parents had already sold their Breath to get enough money to start the business. By selling mine, we got enough money to live for nearly a year!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo price is worth a soul,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStop judging me!\u201d Jewels snapped. \u201cKalad\u2019s Phantoms take you, woman. I was proud to sell my Breath! I still am. A part of me lives inside the God King. Because of me, he continues to live. I\u2019m part of this kingdom in a way that few others are.\u201d\n\nJewels shook her head, turning away. \u201cThat\u2019s why we get annoyed by you Idrians. So high, so certain that what you do is right. If your god asked you to give up your Breath\u2014or even the Breath of your child\u2014wouldn\u2019t you do it? You give up your children to become monks, forcing them into a life of servitude, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s seen as a sign of faith. Yet when we do something to serve our gods, you twist your lips at us and call us blasphemers.\u201d\n\nVivenna opened her mouth, but could come up with no response. Sending children away to become monks was different.\n\n\u201cWe sacrifice for our gods,\u201d Jewels said, still staring out the window. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re being exploited. My family was blessed because of what we did. Not only was there enough money to buy food, but my father recovered, and a few years later, he was able to open up the dye business again. My brothers still run it.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to believe in my miracles. You can call them accidents or coincidences, if you must. But don\u2019t pity me for my faith. And don\u2019t presume that you\u2019re better, just because you believe something different.\u201d\n\nVivenna closed her mouth. Obviously, there was no point in arguing. Jewels was in no mood for her sympathy. Vivenna retreated back up the stairs.\n\n\n\nA few hours later, it began to grow dark. Vivenna stood on the house\u2019s second-story balcony, looking out over the city. Most of the buildings on their street had such balconies on the front. Ostentatious or not, from their hillside location they did provide a good view of T\u2019Telir.\n\nThe city glowed with light. On the larger streets, pole-mounted lamps lined the sidewalks, lit each night by city workers. Many of the buildings were illuminated as well. Such expenditure of oil and candles still amazed her. Yet with the Inner Sea to hand, oil was far cheaper than it was in the highlands.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know what to make of Jewels\u2019s outburst. How could someone be proud that their Breath had been stolen and then fed to a greedy Returned? The woman\u2019s tone seemed to indicate she was being\nsincere. She\u2019d clearly thought about these things before. Obviously, she had to rationalize her experiences to live with them.\n\nVivenna was trapped. The Five Visions taught that she must try to understand others. They told her not to place herself above them. And yet, Austrism taught that what Jewels had done was an abomination.\n\nThe two seemed contradictory. To believe that Jewels was wrong was to place herself above the woman. Yet to accept what Jewels said was to deny Austrism. Some might have laughed at her turmoil, but Vivenna had always tried very hard to be devout. She\u2019d understood that she\u2019d need strict devotion to survive in heathen Hallandren.\n\nHeathen. Didn\u2019t she place herself above Hallandren by calling it that word? But they wereheathen. She couldn\u2019t accept the Returned as true gods. It seemed that to believe in any faith was to become arrogant.\n\nPerhaps she deserved the things Jewels had said to her.\n\nSomeone approached. Vivenna turned as Denth pushed open the wooden door and stepped out onto the balcony. \u201cWe\u2019re back,\u201d he announced.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said, looking out over the city and its specks of light. \u201cI felt you enter the building a little while ago.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled, joining her. \u201cI forget that you have so much Breath, Princess. You never use it.\u201d Except to feel when people are nearby, she thought. But I can\u2019t help that, can I?\n\n\u201cI recognize that look of frustration,\u201d Denth noted. \u201cStill worried that the plan isn\u2019t working fast enough?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cOther things entirely, Denth.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably shouldn\u2019t have left you alone so long with Jewels. I hope she didn\u2019t take too many bites out of you.\u201d\n\nVivenna didn\u2019t respond. Finally, she sighed, then turned toward him. \u201cHow did the job go?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfectly,\u201d Denth said. \u201cBy the time we hit the shop, nobody was looking. Considering the guards they put there every night, they must be feeling pretty stupid to have been robbed in broad daylight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand what good it will do,\u201d she said. \u201cA spice merchant\u2019s shop?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot his shop,\u201d Denth said. \u201cHis stores. We ruined or carted off every barrel of salt in that cellar. He\u2019s one of only three men who store salt in any great amount; most of the other spice merchants buy from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but salt,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow hot was it today?\u201d Denth asked.\n\nVivenna shrugged. \u201cToo hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens to meat when it\u2019s hot?\u201d\n\u201cIt rots,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have to use salt to preserve meat. They can use . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cIce?\u201d Denth asked, chuckling. \u201cNo, not down here, Princess. You want to preserve meat, you salt it. And if you want an army to carry fish with them from the Inner Sea to attack a place as far away as Idris . . .\u201d\n\nVivenna smiled.\n\n\u201cThe thieves we worked with will ship the salt away,\u201d Denth said. \u201cSmuggle it to the distant kingdoms where it can be sold openly. By the time this war comes, the Crown will have some real trouble keeping its men supplied with meat. Just another small strike, but those should add up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Vivenna said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t thank us,\u201d Denth said. \u201cJust pay us.\u201d\n\nVivenna nodded. They fell silent for a time, looking out over the city.\n\n\u201cDoes Jewels really believe in the Iridescent Tones?\u201d Vivenna finally asked.\n\n\u201cAs passionately as Tonk Fah likes to nap,\u201d Denth said. He eyed her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t challenge her, did you?\u201d\n\n\u201cKind of.\u201d\n\nDenth whistled. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still standing? I\u2019ll have to thank her for her restraint.\u201d \u201cHow can she believe?\u201d Vivenna said.\n\nDenth shrugged. \u201cSeems like a good enough religion to me. I mean, you can go and see her gods. Talk to them, watch them shine. It isn\u2019t all that tough to understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s working for an Idrian,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cWorking to undermine her own gods\u2019 ability to wage war. That was a priest\u2019s carriage we knocked over today.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a fairly important one, actually,\u201d Denth said with a chuckle. \u201cAh, Princess. It\u2019s a little difficult to understand. Mind-set of a mercenary. We\u2019re paid to do things\u2014but we\u2019re not the ones doing them. It\u2019s you who do these things. We\u2019re just your tools.\u201d\n\n\u201cTools that work against the Hallandren gods.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t a reason to stop believing,\u201d Denth said. \u201cWe get pretty good at separating ourselves from the things we have to do. Maybe that\u2019s what makes people hate us so much. They can\u2019t see that if we kill a friend on a battlefield, it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re callous or untrustworthy. We do what we\u2019re paid to do. Just like anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d Vivenna said.\n\nDenth shrugged. \u201cDo you think the refiner ever considers that the iron he purifies could end up in a sword that kills a friend of his?\u201d\nVivenna stared out over the lights of the city and all of the people they represented, with all their different beliefs, different ways of thinking, different contradictions. Perhaps she wasn\u2019t the only one who struggled to believe two seemingly opposing things at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhat about you, Denth?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you Hallandren?\u201d \u201cGods, no,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen what do you believe?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t believed much,\u201d he said. \u201cNot in a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about your family?\u201d Vivenna asked. \u201cWhat did they believe?\u201d\n\n\u201cFamily\u2019s all dead. They believed faiths that most everybody has forgotten by now. I never joined them.\u201d\n\nVivenna frowned. \u201cYou have to believe in something. If not a religion, then somebody. A way of living.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did once.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you always have to answer so vaguely?\u201d\n\nHe glanced at her. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cExcept, perhaps, for that question.\u201d She rolled her eyes.\n\nHe leaned against the banister. \u201cThe things I believed,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that they\u2019d make sense, or that you\u2019d even hear me out if I told you about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou claim to seek money,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen Lemex\u2019s ledgers. He wasn\u2019t paying you that much. Not as much as I\u2019d assumed by far. And, if you\u2019d wanted, you could have hit that priest\u2019s carriage and taken the money. You could have stolen it twice as easily as you did the salt.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t respond.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t serve any kingdom or king that I can figure out,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou\u2019re a better swordsman than any simple bodyguard\u2014I suspect better than almost anyone, if you can impress a crime boss with your skill so easily. You could have fame, students, and prizes if you decided to become a sport duelist. You claim to obey your employer, but you give the orders more often than take them\u2014and besides, since you don\u2019t care about money, that whole employee thing is probably just a front.\u201d\n\nShe paused. \u201cIn fact,\u201d she said, \u201cthe only thing I\u2019ve ever seen you express even a spark of emotion about is that man, Vasher. The one with the sword.\u201d\n\nEven as she said the name, Denth grew more tense.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked.\n\nHe turned toward her, eyes hard, showing her\u2014once again\u2014that the jovial man he showed the world was a mask. A charade. A softness to cover the stone within.\n\u201cI\u2019m a mercenary,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, \u201cthen who were you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know the answer to that,\u201d he said. And then he left, stomping away through the door and leaving her alone on the dark wooden balcony.\n\nLightsong awoke and immediately climbed from bed. He stood up, stretched, and smiled. \u201cBeautiful day,\u201d he said.\n\nHis servants stood at the edges of the room, watching uncertainly.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lightsong asked, holding out his arms. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get dressed.\u201d\n\nThey rushed forward. Llarimar entered shortly after. Lightsong often wondered how early he got up, since each morning when Lightsong rose, Llarimar was always there.\n\nLlarimar watched him with a raised eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re chipper this morning, Your Grace.\u201d Lightsong shrugged. \u201cIt just felt like it was time to get up.\u201d \u201cA full hour earlier than usual.\u201d\n\nLightsong cocked his head as the servants tied off his robes. \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cFancy that,\u201d Lightsong said, nodding to his servants as they stepped back, leaving him dressed.\n\n\u201cShall we go over your dreams, then?\u201d Llarimar asked.\n\nLightsong paused, an image flashing in his head. Rain. Tempest. Storms. And a brilliant red panther.\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Lightsong said, walking toward the doorway.\n\n\u201cYour Grace . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about the dreams another time, Scoot,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cWe have more important work.\u201d \u201cMore important work?\u201d\n\nLightsong smiled, reaching the doorway and turning back. \u201cI want to go back to Mercystar\u2019s palace.\u201d \u201cWhatever for?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lightsong said happily.\n\nLlarimar sighed. \u201cVery well, Your Grace. But can we at least look over some art, first? There are people who paid good money to get your opinion, and some are waiting quite eagerly to hear what you think of their pieces.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cBut let\u2019s be quick about it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nLightsong stared at the painting.\nRed upon red, shades so subtle that the painter must have been of the Third Heightening at least. Violent, terrible reds, clashing against one another like waves\u2014waves that only vaguely resembled men, yet that somehow managed to convey the idea of armies fighting much better than any detailed realistic depiction could have.\n\nChaos. Bloody wounds upon bloody uniforms upon bloody skin. There was so much violence in red. His own color. He almost felt as if he were in the painting\u2014felt its turmoil shaking him, disorienting him, pulling on him.\n\nThe waves of men pointed toward one figure at the center. A woman, vaguely depicted by a couple of curved brushstrokes. And yet it was obvious. She stood high, as if atop a cresting wave of crashing soldiers, caught in mid-motion, head flung back, her arm upraised.\n\nHolding a deep black sword that darkened the red sky around it.\n"], "title": ["Warbreaker"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson"]}
