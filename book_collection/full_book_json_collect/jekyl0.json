{"genre": ["Horror"], "text": ["STORY OF THE DOOR\n\nMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was\nnever lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;\nbackward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow\nlovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,\nsomething eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which\nnever found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these\nsilent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in\nthe acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he\nwas alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the\ntheatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had\nan approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with\nenvy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and\nin any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. I incline to\nCain\u2122s heresy, he used to say quaintly: I let my brother go to the\ndevil in his own way. In this character, it was frequently his fortune\nto be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in\nthe lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came\nabout his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\n\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\ncatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept\nhis friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that\nwas the lawyer\u2122s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those\nwhom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the\ngrowth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt\nthe bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,\nthe well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what\nthese two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in\ncommon. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday\nwalks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail\nwith obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two\nmen put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief\njewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\neven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\nuninterrupted.\n\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\nby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is\ncalled quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\ninhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to\ndo better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in\ncoquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an\nair of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday,\nwhen it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of\npassage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood,\nlike a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters,\nwell-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note,\ninstantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.\n\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\nwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\nstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\nin every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on\nthe panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\nhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\nappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their\nravages.\n\nMr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\nwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\npointed.\n\nDid you ever remark that door? he asked; and when his companion had\nreplied in the affirmative, It is connected in my mind, added he,\nwith a very odd story.\n\nIndeed? said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, and what\nwas that?\n\nWell, it was this way, returned Mr. Enfield: I was coming home from\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o\u2122clock of a black\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\nfolks asleep\u201dstreet after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\nand all as empty as a church\u201dtill at last I got into that state of mind\nwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\npoliceman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was\nstumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe\neight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross\nstreet. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the\ncorner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man\ntrampled calmly over the child\u2122s body and left her screaming on the\nground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn\u2122t\nlike a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,\ntook to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where\nthere was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was\nperfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly\nthat it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had\nturned out were the girl\u2122s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for\nwhom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not\nmuch the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there\nyou might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one\ncurious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first\nsight. So had the child\u2122s family, which was only natural. But the\ndoctor\u2122s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry\napothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh\naccent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the\nrest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones\nturn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his\nmind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the\nquestion, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make\nsuch a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end\nof London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we\nundertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were\npitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we\ncould for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such\nhateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of\nblack sneering coolness\u201dfrightened too, I could see that\u201dbut carrying\nit off, sir, really like Satan. \u02dcIf you choose to make capital out of\nthis accident,\u2122 said he, \u02dcI am naturally helpless. No gentleman but\nwishes to avoid a scene,\u2122 says he. \u02dcName your figure.\u2122 Well, we screwed\nhim up to a hundred pounds for the child\u2122s family; he would have\nclearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us\nthat meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get\nthe money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with\nthe door?\u201dwhipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the\nmatter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts\u2122s,\ndrawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can\u2122t mention,\nthough it\u2122s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least\nvery well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the\nsignature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took\nthe liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business\nlooked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a\ncellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man\u2122s\ncheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and\nsneering. \u02dcSet your mind at rest,\u2122 says he, \u02dcI will stay with you till\nthe banks open and cash the cheque myself.\u2122 So we all set off, the\ndoctor, and the child\u2122s father, and our friend and myself, and passed\nthe rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had\nbreakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself,\nand said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of\nit. The cheque was genuine.\n\nTut-tut! said Mr. Utterson.\n\nI see you feel as I do, said Mr. Enfield. Yes, it\u2122s a bad story. For\nmy man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really\ndamnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of\nthe proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your\nfellows who do what they call good. Blackmail, I suppose; an honest man\npaying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail\nHouse is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though\neven that, you know, is far from explaining all, he added, and with\nthe words fell into a vein of musing.\n\nFrom this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: And\nyou don\u2122t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\n\nA likely place, isn\u2122t it? returned Mr. Enfield. But I happen to have\nnoticed his address; he lives in some square or other.\n\nAnd you never asked about the\u201dplace with the door? said Mr. Utterson.\n\nNo, sir; I had a delicacy, was the reply. I feel very strongly about\nputting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of\njudgment. You start a question, and it\u2122s like starting a stone. You sit\nquietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;\nand presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of)\nis knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to\nchange their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks\nlike Queer Street, the less I ask.\n\nA very good rule, too, said the lawyer.\n\nBut I have studied the place for myself, continued Mr. Enfield. It\nseems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or\nout of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my\nadventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first\nfloor; none below; the windows are always shut but they\u2122re clean. And\nthen there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must\nlive there. And yet it\u2122s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\ntogether about the court, that it\u2122s hard to say where one ends and\nanother begins.\n\nThe pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then Enfield,\nsaid Mr. Utterson, that\u2122s a good rule of yours.\n\nYes, I think it is, returned Enfield.\n\nBut for all that, continued the lawyer, there\u2122s one point I want to\nask. I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.\n\nWell, said Mr. Enfield, I can\u2122t see what harm it would do. It was a\nman of the name of Hyde.\n\nHm, said Mr. Utterson. What sort of a man is he to see?\n\nHe is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his\nappearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I\nnever saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be\ndeformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I\ncouldn\u2122t specify the point. He\u2122s an extraordinary looking man, and yet\nI really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand\nof it; I can\u2122t describe him. And it\u2122s not want of memory; for I declare\nI can see him this moment.\n\nMr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a\nweight of consideration. You are sure he used a key? he inquired at\nlast.\n\nMy dear sir... began Enfield, surprised out of himself.\n\nYes, I know, said Utterson; I know it must seem strange. The fact\nis, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I\nknow it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have\nbeen inexact in any point you had better correct it.\n\nI think you might have warned me, returned the other with a touch of\nsullenness. But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The\nfellow had a key; and what\u2122s more, he has it still. I saw him use it\nnot a week ago.\n\nMr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man\npresently resumed. Here is another lesson to say nothing, said he. I\nam ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to\nthis again.\n\nWith all my heart, said the lawyer. I shake hands on that, Richard.\n\n\n\nSEARCH FOR MR. HYDE\n\nThat evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre\nspirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a\nSunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of\nsome dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the\nneighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go\nsoberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the\ncloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business\nroom. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a\ndocument endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll\u2122s Will and sat down\nwith a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for\nMr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had\nrefused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided\nnot only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L.,\nL.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands\nof his friend and benefactor Edward Hyde, but that in case of Dr.\nJekyll\u2122s disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding\nthree calendar months, the said Edward Hyde should step into the said\nHenry Jekyll\u2122s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or\nobligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the\ndoctor\u2122s household. This document had long been the lawyer\u2122s eyesore.\nIt offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and\ncustomary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And\nhitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his\nindignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was\nalready bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn\nno more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable\nattributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so\nlong baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment\nof a fiend.\n\nI thought it was madness, he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper\nin the safe, and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.\n\nWith that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in\nthe direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his\nfriend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding\npatients. If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon, he had thought.\n\nThe solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage\nof delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr.\nLanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,\nred-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a\nboisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\nfrom his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was\nthe way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed\non genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at\nschool and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each\nother, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each\nother\u2122s company.\n\nAfter a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so\ndisagreeably preoccupied his mind.\n\nI suppose, Lanyon, said he, you and I must be the two oldest friends\nthat Henry Jekyll has?\n\nI wish the friends were younger, chuckled Dr. Lanyon. But I suppose\nwe are. And what of that? I see little of him now.\n\nIndeed? said Utterson. I thought you had a bond of common interest.\n\nWe had, was the reply. But it is more than ten years since Henry\nJekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;\nand though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old\nsake\u2122s sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the\nman. Such unscientific balderdash, added the doctor, flushing suddenly\npurple, would have estranged Damon and Pythias.\n\nThis little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.\nThey have only differed on some point of science, he thought; and\nbeing a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of\nconveyancing), he even added: It is nothing worse than that! He gave\nhis friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached\nthe question he had come to put. Did you ever come across a _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9_\nof his\u201done Hyde? he asked.\n\nHyde? repeated Lanyon. No. Never heard of him. Since my time.\n\nThat was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with\nhim to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the\nsmall hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of\nlittle ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged\nby questions.\n\nSix o\u2122clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently\nnear to Mr. Utterson\u2122s dwelling, and still he was digging at the\nproblem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone;\nbut now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he\nlay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained\nroom, Mr. Enfield\u2122s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted\npictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal\ncity; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child\nrunning from the doctor\u2122s; and then these met, and that human\nJuggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams.\nOr else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay\nasleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that\nroom would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the\nsleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to\nwhom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do\nits bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all\nnight; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide\nmore stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and\nstill the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of\nlamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave\nher screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know\nit; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and\nmelted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew\napace in the lawyer\u2122s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,\ncuriosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but\nonce set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps\nroll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well\nexamined. He might see a reason for his friend\u2122s strange preference or\nbondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of\nthe will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man\nwho was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to\nraise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of\nenduring hatred.\n\nFrom that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\nby-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when\nbusiness was plenty and time scarce, at night under the face of the\nfogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or\nconcourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.\n\nIf he be Mr. Hyde, he had thought, I shall be Mr. Seek.\n\nAnd at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost\nin the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps,\nunshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By\nten o\u2122clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very\nsolitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very\nsilent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses\nwere clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of\nthe approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson\nhad been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light\nfootstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had\nlong grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of\na single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out\ndistinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention\nhad never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was\nwith a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into\nthe entry of the court.\n\nThe steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they\nturned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,\ncould soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and\nvery plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went\nsomehow strongly against the watcher\u2122s inclination. But he made\nstraight for the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he\ncame, he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home.\n\nMr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.\nMr. Hyde, I think?\n\nMr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear\nwas only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,\nhe answered coolly enough: That is my name. What do you want?\n\nI see you are going in, returned the lawyer. I am an old friend of\nDr. Jekyll\u2122s\u201dMr. Utterson of Gaunt Street\u201dyou must have heard of my\nname; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.\n\nYou will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home, replied Mr. Hyde,\nblowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,\nHow did you know me? he asked.\n\nOn your side, said Mr. Utterson will you do me a favour?\n\nWith pleasure, replied the other. What shall it be?\n\nWill you let me see your face? asked the lawyer.\n\nMr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden\nreflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared\nat each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. Now I shall know you\nagain, said Mr. Utterson. It may be useful.\n\nYes, returned Mr. Hyde, It is as well we have met; and _\u00c3  propos_,\nyou should have my address. And he gave a number of a street in Soho.\n\nGood God! thought Mr. Utterson, can he, too, have been thinking of\nthe will? But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in\nacknowledgment of the address.\n\nAnd now, said the other, how did you know me?\n\nBy description, was the reply.\n\nWhose description?\n\nWe have common friends, said Mr. Utterson.\n\nCommon friends, echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. Who are they?\n\nJekyll, for instance, said the lawyer.\n\nHe never told you, cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. I did not\nthink you would have lied.\n\nCome, said Mr. Utterson, that is not fitting language.\n\nThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with\nextraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into\nthe house.\n\nThe lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of\ndisquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every\nstep or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental\nperplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a\nclass that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an\nimpression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a\ndispleasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of\nmurderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,\nwhispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against\nhim, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown\ndisgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. There\nmust be something else, said the perplexed gentleman. There _is_\nsomething more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man\nseems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be\nthe old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul\nthat thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The\nlast, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan\u2122s\nsignature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.\n\nRound the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,\nhandsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate\nand let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;\nmap-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure\nenterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still\noccupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of\nwealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for\nthe fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly\nservant opened the door.\n\nIs Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole? asked the lawyer.\n\nI will see, Mr. Utterson, said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he\nspoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,\nwarmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,\nand furnished with costly cabinets of oak. Will you wait here by the\nfire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?\n\nHere, thank you, said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the\ntall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy\nof his friend the doctor\u2122s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of\nit as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder\nin his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what\nwas rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of\nhis spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the\nfirelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the\nshadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently\nreturned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.\n\nI saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole, he said. Is\nthat right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?\n\nQuite right, Mr. Utterson, sir, replied the servant. Mr. Hyde has a\nkey.\n\nYour master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,\nPoole, resumed the other musingly.\n\nYes, sir, he does indeed, said Poole. We have all orders to obey\nhim.\n\nI do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde? asked Utterson.\n\nO, dear no, sir. He never _dines_ here, replied the butler. Indeed\nwe see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes\nand goes by the laboratory.\n\nWell, good-night, Poole.\n\nGood-night, Mr. Utterson.\n\nAnd the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. Poor Harry\nJekyll, he thought, my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was\nwild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of\nGod, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost\nof some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment\ncoming, _pede claudo_, years after memory has forgotten and self-love\ncondoned the fault. And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded\nawhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by\nchance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light\nthere. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of\ntheir life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by\nthe many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and\nfearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.\nAnd then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of\nhope. This Master Hyde, if he were studied, thought he, must have\nsecrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared\nto which poor Jekyll\u2122s worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot\ncontinue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature\nstealing like a thief to Harry\u2122s bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!\nAnd the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the\nwill, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to\nthe wheel\u201dif Jekyll will but let me, he added, if Jekyll will only\nlet me. For once more he saw before his mind\u2122s eye, as clear as\ntransparency, the strange clauses of the will.\n\n\n\nDR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE\n\nA fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of\nhis pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,\nreputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so\ncontrived that he remained behind after the others had departed. This\nwas no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of\ntimes. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to\ndetain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had\nalready their foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his\nunobtrusive company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in\nthe man\u2122s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this\nrule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite\nside of the fire\u201da large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with\nsomething of a stylish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and\nkindness\u201dyou could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson\na sincere and warm affection.\n\nI have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll, began the latter. You\nknow that will of yours?\n\nA close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful;\nbut the doctor carried it off gaily. My poor Utterson, said he, you\nare unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as\nyou were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at\nwhat he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he\u2122s a good fellow\u201dyou\nneedn\u2122t frown\u201dan excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of\nhim; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.\nI was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.\n\nYou know I never approved of it, pursued Utterson, ruthlessly\ndisregarding the fresh topic.\n\nMy will? Yes, certainly, I know that, said the doctor, a trifle\nsharply. You have told me so.\n\nWell, I tell you so again, continued the lawyer. I have been\nlearning something of young Hyde.\n\nThe large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and\nthere came a blackness about his eyes. I do not care to hear more,\nsaid he. This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.\n\nWhat I heard was abominable, said Utterson.\n\nIt can make no change. You do not understand my position, returned\nthe doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. I am painfully\nsituated, Utterson; my position is a very strange\u201da very strange one.\nIt is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.\n\nJekyll, said Utterson, you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a\nclean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you\nout of it.\n\nMy good Utterson, said the doctor, this is very good of you, this is\ndownright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I\nbelieve you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before\nmyself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn\u2122t what you fancy;\nit is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I\nwill tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.\nI give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I\nwill just add one little word, Utterson, that I\u2122m sure you\u2122ll take in\ngood part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.\n\nUtterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.\n\nI have no doubt you are perfectly right, he said at last, getting to\nhis feet.\n\nWell, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last\ntime I hope, continued the doctor, there is one point I should like\nyou to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I\nknow you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do\nsincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if\nI am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear\nwith him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew\nall; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.\n\nI can\u2122t pretend that I shall ever like him, said the lawyer.\n\nI don\u2122t ask that, pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other\u2122s\narm; I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,\nwhen I am no longer here.\n\nUtterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. Well, said he, I promise.\n\n\n\nTHE CAREW MURDER CASE\n\nNearly a year later, in the month of October, 18\u201d, London was startled\nby a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by\nthe high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A\nmaid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone\nupstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in\nthe small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the\nlane, which the maid\u2122s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the\nfull moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon\nher box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a\ndream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she\nnarrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all\nmen or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became\naware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near\nalong the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small\ngentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come\nwithin speech (which was just under the maid\u2122s eyes) the older man\nbowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness.\nIt did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great\nimportance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he\nwere only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he\nspoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such\nan innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something\nhigh too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered\nto the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.\nHyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a\ndislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with which he was trifling;\nbut he answered never a word, and seemed to listen with an\nill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he broke out in a\ngreat flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and\ncarrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The old gentleman\ntook a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle\nhurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to\nthe earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his\nvictim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the\nbones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At\nthe horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted.\n\nIt was two o\u2122clock when she came to herself and called for the police.\nThe murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle\nof the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been\ndone, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had\nbroken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and\none splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter\u201dthe other,\nwithout doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold\nwatch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a\nsealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the\npost, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.\n\nThis was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of\nbed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than\nhe shot out a solemn lip. I shall say nothing till I have seen the\nbody, said he; this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait\nwhile I dress. And with the same grave countenance he hurried through\nhis breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had\nbeen carried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.\n\nYes, said he, I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir\nDanvers Carew.\n\nGood God, sir, exclaimed the officer, is it possible? And the next\nmoment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. This will make a\ndeal of noise, he said. And perhaps you can help us to the man. And\nhe briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken\nstick.\n\nMr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the\nstick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and\nbattered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself\npresented many years before to Henry Jekyll.\n\nIs this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature? he inquired.\n\nParticularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid\ncalls him, said the officer.\n\nMr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, If you will come\nwith me in my cab, he said, I think I can take you to his house.\n\nIt was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the\nseason. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the\nwind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so\nthat as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a\nmarvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be\ndark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,\nlurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,\nfor a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of\ndaylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal\nquarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy\nways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been\nextinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful\nreinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer\u2122s eyes, like a district\nof some city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of\nthe gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive,\nhe was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law\u2122s\nofficers, which may at times assail the most honest.\n\nAs the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a\nlittle and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating\nhouse, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many\nragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many\ndifferent nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning\nglass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part,\nas brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings.\nThis was the home of Henry Jekyll\u2122s favourite; of a man who was heir to\na quarter of a million sterling.\n\nAn ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an\nevil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes,\nshe said, this was Mr. Hyde\u2122s, but he was not at home; he had been in\nthat night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;\nthere was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and\nhe was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she\nhad seen him till yesterday.\n\nVery well, then, we wish to see his rooms, said the lawyer; and when\nthe woman began to declare it was impossible, I had better tell you\nwho this person is, he added. This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland\nYard.\n\nA flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman\u2122s face. Ah! said she,\nhe is in trouble! What has he done?\n\nMr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. He don\u2122t seem a very\npopular character, observed the latter. And now, my good woman, just\nlet me and this gentleman have a look about us.\n\nIn the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained\notherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these\nwere furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with\nwine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung\nupon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who\nwas much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and\nagreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark\nof having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the\nfloor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and\non the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had\nbeen burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end\nof a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the\nother half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched\nhis suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the\nbank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the\nmurderer\u2122s credit, completed his gratification.\n\nYou may depend upon it, sir, he told Mr. Utterson: I have him in my\nhand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick\nor, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money\u2122s life to the man. We\nhave nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the\nhandbills.\n\nThis last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had\nnumbered few familiars\u201deven the master of the servant maid had only\nseen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been\nphotographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as\ncommon observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that was\nthe haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive\nimpressed his beholders.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT OF THE LETTER\n\nIt was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.\nJekyll\u2122s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down\nby the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,\nto the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or\ndissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a\ncelebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than\nanatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of\nthe garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in\nthat part of his friend\u2122s quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless\nstructure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of\nstrangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students\nand now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical\napparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing\nstraw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the\nfurther end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red\nbaize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the\ndoctor\u2122s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses,\nfurnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business\ntable, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred\nwith iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the\nchimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and\nthere, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He\ndid not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him\nwelcome in a changed voice.\n\nAnd now, said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, you have\nheard the news?\n\nThe doctor shuddered. They were crying it in the square, he said. I\nheard them in my dining-room.\n\nOne word, said the lawyer. Carew was my client, but so are you, and\nI want to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide\nthis fellow?\n\nUtterson, I swear to God, cried the doctor, I swear to God I will\nnever set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done\nwith him in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not\nwant my help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite\nsafe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.\n\nThe lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend\u2122s feverish\nmanner. You seem pretty sure of him, said he; and for your sake, I\nhope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.\n\nI am quite sure of him, replied Jekyll; I have grounds for certainty\nthat I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you\nmay advise me. I have\u201dI have received a letter; and I am at a loss\nwhether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in\nyour hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so\ngreat a trust in you.\n\nYou fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection? asked the\nlawyer.\n\nNo, said the other. I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I\nam quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this\nhateful business has rather exposed.\n\nUtterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend\u2122s\nselfishness, and yet relieved by it. Well, said he, at last, let me\nsee the letter.\n\nThe letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed Edward\nHyde: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer\u2122s benefactor,\nDr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand\ngenerosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had\nmeans of escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked\nthis letter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he\nhad looked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.\n\nHave you the envelope? he asked.\n\nI burned it, replied Jekyll, before I thought what I was about. But\nit bore no postmark. The note was handed in.\n\nShall I keep this and sleep upon it? asked Utterson.\n\nI wish you to judge for me entirely, was the reply. I have lost\nconfidence in myself.\n\nWell, I shall consider, returned the lawyer. And now one word more:\nit was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that\ndisappearance?\n\nThe doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth\ntight and nodded.\n\nI knew it, said Utterson. He meant to murder you. You had a fine\nescape.\n\nI have had what is far more to the purpose, returned the doctor\nsolemnly: I have had a lesson\u201dO God, Utterson, what a lesson I have\nhad! And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.\n\nOn his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole.\nBy the bye, said he, there was a letter handed in to-day: what was\nthe messenger like? But Poole was positive nothing had come except by\npost; and only circulars by that, he added.\n\nThis news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the\nletter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been\nwritten in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently\njudged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,\nwere crying themselves hoarse along the footways: Special edition.\nShocking murder of an M.P. That was the funeral oration of one friend\nand client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good\nname of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It\nwas, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and\nself-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for\nadvice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it\nmight be fished for.\n\nPresently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest,\nhis head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely\ncalculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine\nthat had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog\nstill slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps\nglimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these\nfallen clouds, the procession of the town\u2122s life was still rolling in\nthrough the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the\nroom was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago\nresolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows\nricher in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on\nhillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs\nof London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he\nkept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he\nkept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the\ndoctor\u2122s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr.\nHyde\u2122s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it\nnot as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery\nto right? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic\nof handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The\nclerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a\ndocument without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson\nmight shape his future course.\n\nThis is a sad business about Sir Danvers, he said.\n\nYes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,\nreturned Guest. The man, of course, was mad.\n\nI should like to hear your views on that, replied Utterson. I have a\ndocument here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce\nknow what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there\nit is; quite in your way: a murderer\u2122s autograph.\n\nGuest\u2122s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with\npassion. No sir, he said: not mad; but it is an odd hand.\n\nAnd by all accounts a very odd writer, added the lawyer.\n\nJust then the servant entered with a note.\n\nIs that from Dr. Jekyll, sir? inquired the clerk. I thought I knew\nthe writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?\n"], "title": ["Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"], "author": ["Robert Louis Stevenson"]}
