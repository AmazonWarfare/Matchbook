He will be\nin Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my\nother friend, Peter Hawkins. So!\"\n\nWe went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at\nPurfleet. When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the\nnecessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to\nMr. Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a\nplace. I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which I\ninscribe here:--\n\n\"At Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed to\nbe required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place\nwas for sale. It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient structure,\nbuilt of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large number of\nyears. The closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron, all eaten with\nrust.\n\n\"The estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre\nFace_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of\nthe compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by\nthe solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which\nmake it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or\nsmall lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and\nflows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all\nperiods back, I should say, to medi\u00e6val times, for one part is of stone\nimmensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with\niron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or\nchurch. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading\nto it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from\nvarious points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling\nway, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must\nbe very great. There are but few houses close at hand, one being a very\nlarge house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic\nasylum. It is not, however, visible from the grounds.\"\n\nWhen I had finished, he said:--\n\n\"I am glad that it is old and big. I myself am of an old family, and to\nlive in a new house would kill me. A house cannot be made habitable in a\nday; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century. I rejoice\nalso that there is a chapel of old times. We Transylvanian nobles love\nnot to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead. I seek not\ngaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and\nsparkling waters which please the young and gay. I am no longer young;\nand my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead, is not\nattuned to mirth. Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken; the\nshadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken\nbattlements and casements. I love the shade and the shadow, and would\nbe alone with my thoughts when I may.\" Somehow his words and his look\ndid not seem to accord, or else it was that his cast of face made his\nsmile look malignant and saturnine.\n\nPresently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers\ntogether. He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of\nthe books around me. One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally at\nEngland, as if that map had been much used. On looking at it I found in\ncertain places little rings marked, and on examining these I noticed\nthat one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his new\nestate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the\nYorkshire coast.\n\nIt was the better part of an hour when the Count returned. \"Aha!\" he\nsaid; \"still at your books? Good! But you must not work always. Come; I\nam informed that your supper is ready.\" He took my arm, and we went into\nthe next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The\nCount again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from\nhome. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.\nAfter supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with\nme, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour\nafter hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not\nsay anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in\nevery way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified\nme; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at\nthe coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.\nThey say that people who are near death die generally at the change to\nthe dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and\ntied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere\ncan well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up\nwith preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count\nDracula, jumping to his feet, said:--\n\n\"Why, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so\nlong. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of\nEngland less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by\nus,\" and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.\n\nI went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to\nnotice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the\nwarm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again, and have\nwritten of this day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting too\ndiffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first, for\nthere is something so strange about this place and all in it that I\ncannot but feel uneasy. I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had\nnever come. It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on\nme; but would that that were all! If there were any one to talk to I\ncould bear it, but there is no one. I have only the Count to speak with,\nand he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the place. Let\nme be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to bear up, and\nimagination must not run riot with me. If it does I am lost. Let me say\nat once how I stand--or seem to.\n\nI only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could\nnot sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,\nand was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,\nand heard the Count's voice saying to me, \"Good-morning.\" I started, for\nit amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass\ncovered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,\nbut did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count's\nsalutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.\nThis time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I\ncould see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in\nthe mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no\nsign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on\nthe top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague\nfeeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at\nthe instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was\ntrickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half\nround to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his\neyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at\nmy throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which\nheld the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed\nso quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\n\n\"Take care,\" he said, \"take care how you cut yourself. It is more\ndangerous than you think in this country.\" Then seizing the shaving\nglass, he went on: \"And this is the wretched thing that has done the\nmischief. It is a foul bauble of man's vanity. Away with it!\" and\nopening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung\nout the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones\nof the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very\nannoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or\nthe bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.\n\nWhen I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could\nnot find the Count anywhere. So I breakfasted alone. It is strange that\nas yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink. He must be a very\npeculiar man! After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle. I\nwent out on the stairs, and found a room looking towards the South. The\nview was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every opportunity\nof seeing it. The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice. A\nstone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without\ntouching anything! As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree\ntops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and\nthere are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through\nthe forests.\n\nBut I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I\nexplored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and\nbolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there\nan available exit.\n\nThe castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nJONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_\n\n\nWhen I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.\nI rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of\nevery window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my\nhelplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a\nfew hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much\nas a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me\nthat I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done\nanything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done. I\nam thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion. Of\none thing only am I certain; that it is no use making my ideas known to\nthe Count. He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done it\nhimself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only deceive\nme if I trusted him fully with the facts. So far as I can see, my only\nplan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and my eyes\nopen. I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my own fears,\nor else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so, I need, and\nshall need, all my brains to get through.\n\nI had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below\nshut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into\nthe library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making\nthe bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along\nthought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him\nthrough the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the\ndining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these\nmenial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.\nThis gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it\nmust have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that\nbrought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it\nmean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his\nhand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the\ncoach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the\ncrucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless\nthat good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a\ncomfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing\nwhich I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous\nshould in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there\nis something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,\na tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some\ntime, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my\nmind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count\nDracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of\nhimself, if I turn the conversation that way. I must be very careful,\nhowever, not to awake his suspicion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few\nquestions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject\nwonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of\nbattles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he\nafterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house\nand name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their\nfate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said \"we,\"\nand spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put\ndown all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most\nfascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He\ngrew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great\nwhite moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as\nthough he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I\nshall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of\nhis race:--\n\n\"We Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood\nof many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship. Here,\nin the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from\nIceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their\nBerserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay,\nand of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the\nwere-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they found\nthe Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,\ntill the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those\nold witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the\ndesert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as\nAttila, whose blood is in these veins?\" He held up his arms. \"Is it a\nwonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the\nMagyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his\nthousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when\nArpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us\nhere when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed\nthere? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were\nclaimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries\nwas trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more\nthan that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,\n'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.' Who more gladly than we\nthroughout the Four Nations received the 'bloody sword,' or at its\nwarlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was\nredeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the\nflags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent? Who\nwas it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat\nthe Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that\nhis own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the\nTurk and brought the shame of slavery on them! Was it not this Dracula,\nindeed, who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and\nagain brought his forces over the great river into Turkey-land; who,\nwhen he was beaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had\nto come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being\nslaughtered, since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph! They\nsaid that he thought only of himself. Bah! what good are peasants\nwithout a leader? Where ends the war without a brain and heart to\nconduct it? Again, when, after the battle of Moh\u00e1cs, we threw off the\nHungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for\nour spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the\nSzekelys--and the Dracula as their heart's blood, their brains, and\ntheir swords--can boast a record that mushroom growths like the\nHapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over.\nBlood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and\nthe glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.\"\n\nIt was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed. (_Mem._, this\ndiary seems horribly like the beginning of the \"Arabian Nights,\" for\neverything has to break off at cockcrow--or like the ghost of Hamlet's\nfather.)\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by\nbooks and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not\nconfuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own\nobservation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from\nhis room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the\ndoing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over\nbooks, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the\nmatters I had been examined in at Lincoln's Inn. There was a certain\nmethod in the Count's inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in\nsequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.\n\nFirst, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I\ntold him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be\nwise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only\none could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to militate\nagainst his interest. He seemed thoroughly to understand, and went on to\nask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to\nattend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in case\nlocal help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking\nsolicitor. I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by any\nchance mislead him, so he said:--\n\n\"I shall illustrate. Your friend and mine, Mr. Peter Hawkins, from under\nthe shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far from\nLondon, buys for me through your good self my place at London. Good! Now\nhere let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange that I have\nsought the services of one so far off from London instead of some one\nresident there, that my motive was that no local interest might be\nserved save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,\nhave some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to\nseek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose\nI, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or\nDurham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more\nease be done by consigning to one in these ports?\" I answered that\ncertainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of\nagency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on\ninstruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing\nhimself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by\nhim without further trouble.\n\n\"But,\" said he, \"I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied; and \"such is often done by men of business, who\ndo not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.\"\n\n\"Good!\" he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making\nconsignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of\ndifficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded\nagainst. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,\nand he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a\nwonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or\nforesee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not\nevidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were\nwonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had\nspoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books\navailable, he suddenly stood up and said:--\n\n\"Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter\nHawkins, or to any other?\" It was with some bitterness in my heart that\nI answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of\nsending letters to anybody.\n\n\"Then write now, my young friend,\" he said, laying a heavy hand on my\nshoulder: \"write to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will\nplease you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.\"\n\n\"Do you wish me to stay so long?\" I asked, for my heart grew cold at the\nthought.\n\n\"I desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal. When your master,\nemployer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,\nit was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not\nstinted. Is it not so?\"\n\nWhat could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins's interest, not\nmine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count\nDracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing\nwhich made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I\ncould have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his\nmastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but\nin his own smooth, resistless way:--\n\n\"I pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things\nother than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your\nfriends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting\nhome to them. Is it not so?\" As he spoke he handed me three sheets of\nnote-paper and three envelopes. They were all of the thinnest foreign\npost, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile,\nwith the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood\nas well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for\nhe would be able to read it. So I determined to write only formal notes\nnow, but to write fully to Mr. Hawkins in secret, and also to Mina, for\nto her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle the Count, if he\ndid see it. When I had written my two letters I sat quiet, reading a\nbook whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring as he wrote them to\nsome books on his table. Then he took up my two and placed them with his\nown, and put by his writing materials, after which, the instant the door\nhad closed behind him, I leaned over and looked at the letters, which\nwere face down on the table. I felt no compunction in doing so, for\nunder the circumstances I felt that I should protect myself in every way\nI could.\n\nOne of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The\nCrescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to\nCoutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,\nbankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just\nabout to look at them when I saw the door-handle move. I sank back in my\nseat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and\nto resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his\nhand, entered the room. He took up the letters on the table and stamped\nthem carefully, and then turning to me, said:--\n\n\"I trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private this\nevening. You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.\" At the door he\nturned, and after a moment's pause said:--\n\n\"Let me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with all\nseriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any\nchance go to sleep in any other part of the castle. It is old, and has\nmany memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely. Be\nwarned! Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do, then\nhaste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will then be\nsafe. But if you be not careful in this respect, then\"--He finished his\nspeech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands as if he were\nwashing them. I quite understood; my only doubt was as to whether any\ndream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible net of gloom\nand mystery which seemed closing around me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no\ndoubt in question. I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is\nnot. I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that\nmy rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.\n\nWhen he left me I went to my room. After a little while, not hearing any\nsound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out\ntowards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,\ninaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness\nof the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in\nprison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of\nthe night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.\nIt is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all\nsorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my\nterrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful\nexpanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as\nday. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows\nin the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed\nto cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I\nleaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey\nbelow me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of\nthe rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out. The\nwindow at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though\nweatherworn, was still complete; but it was evidently many a day since\nthe case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked\ncarefully out.\n\nWhat I saw was the Count's head coming out from the window. I did not\nsee the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his\nback and arms. In any case I could not mistake the hands which I had had\nso many opportunities of studying. I was at first interested and\nsomewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest\nand amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to\nrepulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the\nwindow and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,\n_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At\nfirst I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the\nmoonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could\nbe no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the\nstones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus\nusing every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable\nspeed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.\n\nWhat manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the\nsemblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering\nme; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am\nencompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard fashion.\nHe moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down, and a good\ndeal to the left. He vanished into some hole or window. When his head\nhad disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without\navail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I\nknew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to\nexplore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and\ntaking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had\nexpected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the\nstone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could\npull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the\ndoor was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count's\nroom; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and\nescape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs\nand passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two\nsmall rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in\nthem except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,\nhowever, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it\nseemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,\nand found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came\nfrom the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door\nrested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have\nagain, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that\nI could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right\nthan the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could\nsee that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle, the\nwindows of the end room looking out both west and south. On the latter\nside, as well as to the former, there was a great precipice. The castle\nwas built on the corner of a great rock, so that on three sides it was\nquite impregnable, and great windows were placed here where sling, or\nbow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently light and comfort,\nimpossible to a position which had to be guarded, were secured. To the\nwest was a great valley, and then, rising far away, great jagged\nmountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer rock studded with\nmountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and\ncrannies of the stone. This was evidently the portion of the castle\noccupied by the ladies in bygone days, for the furniture had more air of\ncomfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the\nyellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to\nsee even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over\nall and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My\nlamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was\nglad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place\nwhich chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better\nthan living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the\npresence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I\nfound a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak\ntable where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much\nthought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my\ndiary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last. It is\nnineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance. And yet, unless my\nsenses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have, powers of their own\nwhich mere \"modernity\" cannot kill.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I\nam reduced. Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.\nWhilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for, that I may not\ngo mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already. If I be sane, then surely it\nis maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this\nhateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone I\ncan look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his\npurpose. Great God! merciful God! Let me be calm, for out of that way\nlies madness indeed. I begin to get new lights on certain things which\nhave puzzled me. Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant\nwhen he made Hamlet say:--\n\n    \"My tablets! quick, my tablets!\n    'Tis meet that I put it down,\" etc.,\n\nfor now, feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock\nhad come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.\nThe habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.\n\nThe Count's mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens\nme more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold upon\nme. I shall fear to doubt what he may say!\n\nWhen I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and\npen in my pocket I felt sleepy. The Count's warning came into my mind,\nbut I took a pleasure in disobeying it. The sense of sleep was upon me,\nand with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider. The soft\nmoonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom\nwhich refreshed me. I determined not to return to-night to the\ngloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where, of old, ladies had sat\nand sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for\ntheir menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars. I drew a great\ncouch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look\nat the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for\nthe dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen\nasleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all that followed was startlingly\nreal--so real that now sitting here in the broad, full sunlight of the\nmorning, I cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep.\n\nI was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I\ncame into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,\nmy own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of\ndust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by\ntheir dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming\nwhen I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw\nno shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some\ntime, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline\nnoses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be\nalmost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was\nfair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes\nlike pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it\nin connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the\nmoment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like\npearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something\nabout them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some\ndeadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would\nkiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some\nday it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.\nThey whispered together, and then they all three laughed--such a\nsilvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have\ncome through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable,\ntingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on by a cunning hand.\nThe fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her\non. One said:--\n\n\"Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to\nbegin.\" The other added:--\n\n\"He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.\" I lay quiet,\nlooking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.\nThe fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement\nof her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent\nthe same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter\nunderlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.\n\nI was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under\nthe lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply\ngloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling\nand repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips\nlike an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining\non the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp\nteeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of\nmy mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat. Then she\npaused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked\nher teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the\nskin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that\nis to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,\nshivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,\nand the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.\nI closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating\nheart.\n\nBut at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as\nlightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his\nbeing as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I\nsaw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with\ngiant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the\nwhite teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with\npassion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even to\nthe demons of the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light\nin them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His\nface was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires;\nthe thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar\nof white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman\nfrom him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating\nthem back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the\nwolves. In a voice which, though low and almost in a whisper seemed to\ncut through the air and then ring round the room he said:--\n\n\"How dare you touch him, any of you? How dare you cast eyes on him when\nI had forbidden it? Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me! Beware\nhow you meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me.\" The fair girl,\nwith a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--\n\n\"You yourself never loved; you never love!\" On this the other women\njoined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the\nroom that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure\nof fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,\nand said in a soft whisper:--\n\n\"Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it\nnot so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall\nkiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work\nto be done.\"\n\n\"Are we to have nothing to-night?\" said one of them, with a low laugh,\nas she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which\nmoved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he\nnodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my\nears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a\nhalf-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with\nhorror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful\nbag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me\nwithout my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the\nmoonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the\ndim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.\n\nThen the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nJONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_\n\n\nI awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must\nhave carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but\ncould not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were\ncertain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by\nin a manner which was not my habit. My watch was still unwound, and I am\nrigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed, and\nmany such details. But these things are no proof, for they may have been\nevidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause or\nanother, I had certainly been much upset. I must watch for proof. Of one\nthing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and undressed\nme, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are intact. I\nam sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not\nhave brooked. He would have taken or destroyed it. As I look round this\nroom, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now a sort of\nsanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women, who\nwere--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for\nI _must_ know the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the\nstairs I found it closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the\njamb that part of the woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt\nof the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside.\nI fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_19 May._--I am surely in the toils. Last night the Count asked me in\nthe suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work here\nwas nearly done, and that I should start for home within a few days,\nanother that I was starting on the next morning from the time of the\nletter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived at\nBistritz. I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present state\nof things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count whilst I\nam so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to excite his\nsuspicion and to arouse his anger. He knows that I know too much, and\nthat I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my only chance is to\nprolong my opportunities. Something may occur which will give me a\nchance to escape. I saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath\nwhich was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him. He explained\nto me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my writing now would\nensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured me with so much\nimpressiveness that he would countermand the later letters, which would\nbe held over at Bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my\nprolonging my stay, that to oppose him would have been to create new\nsuspicion. I therefore pretended to fall in with his views, and asked\nhim what dates I should put on the letters. He calculated a minute, and\nthen said:--\n\n\"The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June\n29.\"\n\nI know now the span of my life. God help me!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_28 May._--There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to\nsend word home. A band of Szgany have come to the castle, and are\nencamped in the courtyard. These Szgany are gipsies; I have notes of\nthem in my book. They are peculiar to this part of the world, though\nallied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over. There are thousands\nof them in Hungary and Transylvania, who are almost outside all law.\nThey attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or _boyar_, and\ncall themselves by his name. They are fearless and without religion,\nsave superstition, and they talk only their own varieties of the Romany\ntongue.\n\nI shall write some letters home, and shall try to get them to have them\nposted. I have already spoken them through my window to begin\nacquaintanceship. They took their hats off and made obeisance and many\nsigns, which, however, I could not understand any more than I could\ntheir spoken language....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have written the letters. Mina's is in shorthand, and I simply ask Mr.\nHawkins to communicate with her. To her I have explained my situation,\nbut without the horrors which I may only surmise. It would shock and\nfrighten her to death were I to expose my heart to her. Should the\nletters not carry, then the Count shall not yet know my secret or the\nextent of my knowledge....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have given the letters; I threw them through the bars of my window\nwith a gold piece, and made what signs I could to have them posted. The\nman who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed, and then put them\nin his cap. I could do no more. I stole back to the study, and began to\nread. As the Count did not come in, I have written here....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Count has come. He sat down beside me, and said in his smoothest\nvoice as he opened two letters:--\n\n\"The Szgany has given me these, of which, though I know not whence they\ncome, I shall, of course, take care. See!\"--he must have looked at\nit--\"one is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other\"--here\nhe caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and\nthe dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--\"the\nother is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality! It is\nnot signed. Well! so it cannot matter to us.\" And he calmly held letter\nand envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed. Then he\nwent on:--\n\n\"The letter to Hawkins--that I shall, of course, send on, since it is\nyours. Your letters are sacred to me. Your pardon, my friend, that\nunknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?\" He held\nout the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean\nenvelope. I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence. When\nhe went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly. A minute later\nI went over and tried it, and the door was locked.\n\nWhen, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his\ncoming awakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa. He was very\ncourteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been\nsleeping, he said:--\n\n\"So, my friend, you are tired? Get to bed. There is the surest rest. I\nmay not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many labours\nto me; but you will sleep, I pray.\" I passed to my room and went to bed,\nand, strange to say, slept without dreaming. Despair has its own calms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_31 May._--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself\nwith some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket, so\nthat I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a\nsurprise, again a shock!\n\nEvery scrap of paper was gone, and with it all my notes, my memoranda,\nrelating to railways and travel, my letter of credit, in fact all that\nmight be useful to me were I once outside the castle. I sat and pondered\nawhile, and then some thought occurred to me, and I made search of my\nportmanteau and in the wardrobe where I had placed my clothes.\n\nThe suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and\nrug; I could find no trace of them anywhere. This looked like some new\nscheme of villainy....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed\ncudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding\nand scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.\nWith joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great\nleiter-wagons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of\neach pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great nail-studded belt, dirty\nsheepskin, and high boots. They had also their long staves in hand. I\nran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through the\nmain hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them. Again a\nshock: my door was fastened on the outside.\n\nThen I ran to the window and cried to them. They looked up at me\nstupidly and pointed, but just then the \"hetman\" of the Szgany came out,\nand seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which they\nlaughed. Henceforth no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised\nentreaty, would make them even look at me. They resolutely turned away.\nThe leiter-wagons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick\nrope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks\nhandled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved. When\nthey were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the\nyard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on\nit for luck, lazily went each to his horse's head. Shortly afterwards, I\nheard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and\nlocked himself into his own room. As soon as I dared I ran up the\nwinding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I\nthought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.\nThe Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of\nsome kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound\nas of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some\nruthless villainy.\n\nI had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw\nsomething coming out of the Count's window. I drew back and watched\ncarefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to\nfind that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst\ntravelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I\nhad seen the women take away. There could be no doubt as to his quest,\nand in my garb, too! This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he will\nallow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave\nevidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own\nletters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local\npeople be attributed to me.\n\nIt makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up\nhere, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which"], "title": ["Dracula"], "author": ["Bram Stoker"]}
