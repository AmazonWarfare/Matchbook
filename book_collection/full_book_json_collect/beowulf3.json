See Orosius\n    (Sweet's ed.) 178_7; 204_34; 208_28; 210_15; 280_20. In the two\n    Beowulf passages, the \u00fe\u00e6t-clause is anticipated by '\u00fe\u00e6s,' which is\n    clearly a gen. of the thing agreed on.\n\n    The first passage (v. 1599 (b)-1600) I translate literally: _Then many\n    agreed upon this (namely), that the sea-wolf had killed him_.\n\n    The second passage (v. 2025 (b)-2027): _She is promised ...; to this\n    the friend of the Scyldings has agreed, etc_. By emending 'is' instead\n    of 'w\u00e6s' (2025), the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony.\n\n    In v. 1997 ff. this same idiom occurs, and was noticed in B.'s great\n    article on Beowulf, which appeared about the time I published my\n    reading of 1599 and 2027. Translate 1997 then: _Wouldst let the\n    South-Danes themselves decide about their struggle with Grendel_. Here\n    'S\u00fa\u00f0-Dene' is accus. of person, and 'g\u00fa\u00f0e' is gen. of thing agreed on.\n\n    With such collateral support as that afforded by B. (P. and B. XII.\n    97), I have no hesitation in departing from H.-So., my usual guide.\n\n    The idiom above treated runs through A.-S., Old Saxon, and other\n    Teutonic languages, and should be noticed in the lexicons.\n\n    [2] 'Br\u00f3den-m\u00e6l' is regarded by most scholars as meaning a damaskeened\n    sword.

But the weeping is mentioned before the 'expectations':\n    the tears may have been due to many emotions, especially gratitude,\n    struggling for expression.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII.\n\nTHE HOMEWARD JOURNEY.--THE TWO QUEENS.\n\n\n          Then the band of very valiant retainers\n          Came to the current; they were clad all in armor,\n\n{The coast-guard again.}\n\n          In link-woven burnies. The land-warder noticed\n          The return of the earlmen, as he erstwhile had seen them;\n        5 Nowise with insult he greeted the strangers\n          From the naze of the cliff, but rode on to meet them;\n          Said the bright-armored visitors[1] vesselward traveled\n[65]      Welcome to Weders.

[2]Set he out on his vessel,\n       15 To drive on the deep, Dane-country left he.\n          Along by the mast then a sea-garment fluttered,\n          A rope-fastened sail. The sea-boat resounded,\n          The wind o'er the waters the wave-floater nowise\n          Kept from its journey; the sea-goer traveled,\n       20 The foamy-necked floated forth o'er the currents,\n          The well-fashioned vessel o'er the ways of the ocean,\n\n{The Geats see their own land again.}\n\n          Till they came within sight of the cliffs of the Geatmen,\n          The well-known headlands.

Accepting this,\n    we may render: _He said the bright-armored warriors were going to\n    their vessel, welcome, etc_. (Cf. 1804.)\n\n    [2] R. suggests, 'Gew\u00e1t him on naca,' and renders: _The vessel set\n    out, to drive on the sea, the Dane-country left_. 'On' bears the\n    alliteration; cf. 'on hafu' (2524). This has some advantages over the\n    H.-So. reading; viz. (1) It adds nothing to the text; (2) it makes\n    'naca' the subject, and thus brings the passage into keeping with the\n    context, where the poet has exhausted his vocabulary in detailing the\n    actions of the vessel.--B.'s emendation (cf. P. and B. XII. 97) is\n    violent.\n\n    [3] B. translates: _Who for a long time, ready at the coast, had\n    looked out into the distance eagerly for the dear men_. This changes\n    the syntax of 'l\u00e9ofra manna.'\n\n    [4] For 'wuna\u00f0' (v. 1924) several eminent critics suggest 'wunade'\n    (=remained). This makes the passage much clearer.\n\n    [5] Why should such a woman be described as an 'excellent' queen? C.\n    suggests 'fr\u00e9cnu' = dangerous, bold.\n\n    [6] For 'an d\u00e6ges' various readings have been offered. If 'and-\u00e9ges'\n    be accepted, the sentence will read: _No hero ... dared look upon her,\n    eye to eye_. If '\u00e1n-d\u00e6ges' be adopted, translate: _Dared look upon her\n    the whole day_.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX.\n\nBEOWULF AND HIGELAC.\n\n\n          Then the brave one departed, his band along with him,\n\n{Beowulf and his party seek Higelac.}\n\n          Seeking the sea-shore, the sea-marches treading,\n          The wide-stretching shores. The world-candle glimmered,\n          The sun from the southward; they proceeded then onward,\n        5 Early arriving where they heard that the troop-lord,\n          Ongentheow's slayer, excellent, youthful\n          Folk-prince and warrior was distributing jewels,\n          Close in his castle. The coming of Beowulf\n          Was announced in a message quickly to Higelac,\n       10 That the folk-troop's defender forth to the palace\n          The linden-companion alive was advancing,\n          Secure from the combat courtward a-going.\n          The building was early inward made ready\n          For the foot-going guests as the good one had ordered.\n\n{Beowulf sits by his liegelord.}\n\n       15 He sat by the man then who had lived through the struggle,\n          Kinsman by kinsman, when the king of the people\n          Had in lordly language saluted the dear one,\n\n{Queen Hygd receives the heroes.}\n\n          In words that were formal. The daughter of H\u00e6reth\n          Coursed through the building, carrying mead-cups:[1]\n[68]   20 She loved the retainers, tendered the beakers\n          To the high-minded Geatmen. Higelac 'gan then\n\n{Higelac is greatly interested in Beowulf's adventures.}\n\n          Pleasantly plying his companion with questions\n          In the high-towering palace. A curious interest\n          Tormented his spirit, what meaning to see in\n       25 The Sea-Geats' adventures: \"Beowulf worthy,\n\n{Give an account of thy adventures, Beowulf dear.}\n\n          How throve your journeying, when thou thoughtest suddenly\n          Far o'er the salt-streams to seek an encounter,\n          A battle at Heorot?

Accepting this, translate: _Who longest lives of the hated race,\n    steeped in treachery_.\n\n    [4] See note to v. 1599 above.\n\n    [5] This is perhaps the least understood sentence in the poem, almost\n    every word being open to dispute. (1) The 'n\u00f3' of our text is an\n    emendation, and is rejected by many scholars. (2) 'Seldan' is by some\n    taken as an adv. (= _seldom_), and by others as a noun (= _page_,\n    _companion_). (3) 'L\u00e9od-hryre,' some render '_fall of the people_';\n    others, '_fall of the prince_.' (4) 'B\u00fage\u00f0,' most scholars regard as\n    the intrans. verb meaning '_bend_,' '_rest_'; but one great scholar has\n    translated it '_shall kill_.' (5) 'Hw\u00e6r,' Very recently, has been\n    attacked, 'w\u00e6re' being suggested.
