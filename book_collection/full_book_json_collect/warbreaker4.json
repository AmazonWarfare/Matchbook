Finally, she sighed, turning away. The usual fire crackled in the hearth, but it was smaller than previously.\n\nHe was there. Siri didn\u2019t need to look to see him. As her eyes grew more accustomed to the darkness, she could notice that the fire\u2019s colors\u2014blue, orange, even black\u2014were far too true, far too vibrant. Her gown, a brilliant golden satin, seemed to burn with its own inner color. Anything that was white\u2014some of the lace on her dress, for instance\u2014bent slightly, giving off a rainbow of colors as if seen through a prism. Part of her wished for a well-lit room, where she could experience the full beauty of BioChroma.\nBut, of course, that was not right. The God King\u2019s Breath was a perversion. He was fed on the souls of his people, and the colors he evoked came at their expense.\n\nShivering, Siri undid the side of her dress, then let the garment fall to pieces around her\u2014the long sleeves slipping free, bodice falling forward, skirt and gown rustling as they dropped to the floor. She completed the ritual, sliding the straps of her shift off her shoulders, then dropping the garment to the floor beside the gown. She stepped free of both, then bowed herself down into her customary posture.\n\nHer back complained, and she ruefully contemplated another uncomfortable night. The least they could do, she thought, is make certain the fire is large enough. At night in the large stone palace, it got chilly despite the Hallandren tropical climate. Particularly if one were naked.\n\nFocus on Bluefingers, she thought, trying to distract herself. What did he mean? Things are not what they seem in the palace?\n\nWas he referring to the God King and his ability to have her killed? She was well aware of the God King\u2019s power. How could she forget it, with him sitting not fifteen feet away, watching from the shadows? No, that wasn\u2019t it. He\u2019d felt he\u2019d needed to give this warning quietly, without others hearing. Watch yourself. . . .\n\nIt smelled of politics. She gritted her teeth. If she\u2019d paid more attention to her tutors, might she have been able to pick out a more subtle meaning in Bluefingers\u2019s warning?\n\nAs if I needed something else to be confused about, she thought. If Bluefingers had something to tell her, why hadn\u2019t he just said it? As the minutes passed, his words turned over and over in her mind like a restless sleeper, but she was too uncomfortable and cold to come to any conclusions. That only left her feeling more annoyed.\n\nVivenna would have figured it out. Vivenna probably would have known instinctively why the God King hadn\u2019t chosen to sleep with her. She would have fixed it the first night.\n\nBut Siri was incompetent. She tried so hard to do as Vivenna would have\u2014to be the best wife she could, to serve Idris. To be the woman that everyone expected her to be.\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t just keep doing this. She felt trapped in the palace. She couldn\u2019t get the priests to do more than roll their eyes at her. She couldn\u2019t even tempt the God King to bed her. On top of that, she could very well be in danger, and she couldn\u2019t even understand why or how.\n\nIn simpler terms, she was just plain frustrated.\n\nGroaning at her aching limbs, Siri sat up in the dark room and looked at the shadowy form in the corner. \u201cWill you please just get on with it?\u201d she blurted out.\n\nSilence.\n\nSiri felt her hair bleach a terrible bone white as she realized what she\u2019d just done. She stiffened, casting her eyes down, weariness fleeing in the face of sudden anxiety.\n\nWhat had she been thinking? The God King could call servants to execute her. In fact, he didn\u2019t even need that. He could bring her own dress to life, Awakening it to strangle her. He could make the rug rise\nup and smother her. He could probably bring the ceiling down on her, all without moving from his chair.\n\nSiri waited, breathing with shallow anxiety, anticipating the fury and retribution. But . . . nothing happened. Minutes passed.\n\nFinally, Siri glanced up. The God King had moved, sitting up straighter, regarding her from his darkened chair beside the bed. She could see his eyes reflecting the firelight. She couldn\u2019t make out much of his face, but he didn\u2019t seem angry. He just seemed cold and distant.\n\nShe almost cast her eyes down again, but hesitated. If snapping at him wouldn\u2019t provoke a reaction, then looking at him wasn\u2019t likely to either. So she turned her chin up and met his eyes, knowing full well that she was being foolish. Vivenna would never have provoked the man. She would have remained quiet and demure, either solving the problem or\u2014if there was no solution\u2014kneeling every night until her patience impressed even the God King of Hallandren.\n\nBut Siri was not Vivenna. She was just going to have to accept that fact.\n\nThe God King continued to look at her, and Siri found herself blushing. She\u2019d knelt before him naked six nights in a row, but facing him unclothed was more embarrassing. Still, she didn\u2019t back down. She continued to kneel, watching him, forcing herself to stay awake.\n\nIt was difficult. She was tired, and the position was actually less comfortable than bowing had been.\n\nShe watched anyway, waiting, the hours passing.\n\nEventually\u2014at about the same time that he left the room every night\u2014the God King stood up. Siri stiffened, shocked alert. However, he simply walked to the door. He tapped quietly, and it opened for him, servants waiting on the other side. He stepped out and the door closed.\n\nSiri waited tensely. No soldiers came to arrest her; no priests came to chastise her. Eventually, she just walked over to the bed and burrowed into its covers, savoring the warmth.\n\nThe God King\u2019s wrath, she thought drowsily, is decidedly less wrathful than reported.\n\nWith that, she fell asleep.\n\nEventually, Lightsong had to hear petitions.\n\nIt was annoying, since the Wedding Jubilation wouldn\u2019t even be over for another few days. The people, however, needed their gods. He knew he shouldn\u2019t feel annoyed. He\u2019d gotten most of a week off for the wedding fete\u2014conspicuously unattended by either the bride or groom\u2014and that was enough. All he had to do was spend a few hours each day looking at art and listening to the woes of the people. It wasn\u2019t much. Even if it did wear away at his sanity.\n\nHe sighed, sitting back in his throne. He wore an embroidered cap on his head, matched by a loose robe of gold and red. The garment wrapped over both shoulders, twisted about his body, and was hung with golden tassels. Like all of his clothing, it was even more complicated to put on than it looked.\n\nIf my servants were to suddenly leave me, he thought with amusement, I\u2019d be totally incapable of getting dressed.\nHe leaned his head on one fist, elbow on the throne\u2019s armrest. This room of his palace opened directly out onto the lawn\u2014harsh weather was rare in Hallandren, and a cool breeze blew in off of the sea, smelling of brine. He closed his eyes, breathing in.\n\nHe\u2019d dreamed of war again last night. Llarimar had found that particularly meaningful. Lightsong was just disturbed. Everyone said that if war did come, Hallandren would easily win. But if that were the case, then why did he always dream of T\u2019Telir burning? Not some distant Idrian city, but his own home.\n\nIt means nothing, he told himself. Just a manifestation of my own worries.\n\n\u201cNext petition, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar whispered from his side.\n\nLightsong sighed, opening his eyes. Both edges of the room were lined with priests in their coifs and robes. Where had he gotten so many? Did any god need that much attention?\n\nHe could see a line of people extending outside onto the lawn. They were a sorry, forlorn lot, several coughing from some malady or another. So many, he thought as a woman was led into the room. He\u2019d been seeing petitioners for over an hour already. I guess I should have expected this. It\u2019s been almost a week.\n\n\u201cScoot,\u201d he said, turning to his priest. \u201cGo tell those waiting people to sit down in the grass. There\u2019s no reason for them to all stand there like that. This could take some time.\u201d\n\nLlarimar hesitated. Standing was, of course, a sign of respect. However, he nodded, waving over a lesser priest to carry the message.\n\nSuch a crowd, waiting to see me, Lightsong thought. What will it take to convince the people that I\u2019m useless? What would it take to get them to stop coming to him? After five years of petitions, he honestly wasn\u2019t certain if he could take another five.\n\nThe newest petitioner approached his throne. She carried a child in her arms.\n\nNot a child . . . Lightsong thought, cringing mentally.\n\n\u201cGreat One,\u201d the woman said, falling to her knees on the carpet. \u201cLord of Bravery.\u201d Lightsong didn\u2019t speak.\n\n\u201cThis is my child, Halan,\u201d the woman said, holding out the baby. As it got close enough to Lightsong\u2019s aura, the blanket burst with a sharp blue color two and half steps from pure. He could easily see that the child was suffering from a terrible sickness. It had lost so much weight that its skin was shriveled. The baby\u2019s Breath was so weak that it flickered like a candle running out of wick. It would be dead before the day was out. Perhaps before the hour was out.\n\n\u201cThe healers, they say he has deathfever,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI know that he\u2019s going to die.\u201d The baby made a sound\u2014a kind of half-cough, perhaps the closest it could get to a cry.\n\n\u201cPlease, Great One,\u201d the woman said. She sniffled, then bowed her head. \u201cOh, please. He was brave, like you. My Breath, it would be yours. The Breaths of my entire family. Ser vice for a hundred years, anything. Please, just heal him.\u201d\nLightsong closed his eyes.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d the woman whispered.\n\n\u201cI cannot,\u201d Lightsong said.\n\nSilence.\n\n\u201cI cannot,\u201d Lightsong said.\n\n\u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d the woman finally whispered.\n\nLightsong opened his eyes to see the woman being led away, weeping quietly, child clutched close to her breast. The line of people watched her go, looking miserable yet hopeful at the same time. One more petitioner had failed. That meant they would get a chance.\n\nA chance to beg Lightsong to kill himself.\n\nLightsong stood suddenly, grabbing the cap off his head and tossing it aside. He rushed away, throwing open a door at the back of the room. It slammed against the wall as he stumbled through.\n\nServants and priests immediately followed after him. He turned on them. \u201cGo!\u201d he said, waving them away. Many of them showed looks of surprise, unaccustomed to any kind of forcefulness on their master\u2019s part.\n\n\u201cLeave me be!\u201d he shouted, towering over them. Colors in the room flared brighter in response to his emotion, and the servants backed down, confused, stumbling back out into the petition hall and pulling the door closed.\n\nLightsong stood alone. He placed one hand against the wall, breathing in and out, other hand against his forehead. Why was he sweating so? He\u2019d been through thousands of petitions, and many had been worse than the one he\u2019d just seen. He\u2019d sent pregnant women to their deaths, doomed children and parents, consigned the innocent and the faithful to misery.\n\nThere was no reason to overreact. He could take it. It was a little thing, really. Just like absorbing the Breath of a new person every week. A small price to pay . . .\n\nThe door opened and a figure stepped in.\n\nLightsong didn\u2019t turn. \u201cWhat do they want of me, Llarimar?\u201d he demanded. \u201cDo they really think I\u2019ll do it? Lightsong, the selfish? Do they really think I\u2019d give my life for one of them?\u201d\n\nLlarimar was quiet for a few moments. \u201cYou offer hope, Your Grace,\u201d he finally said. \u201cA last, unlikely hope. Hope is part of faith\u2014part of the knowledge that someday, one of your followers will receive a miracle.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if they\u2019re wrong?\u201d Lightsong asked. \u201cI have no desire to die. I\u2019m an idle man, fond of luxury. People like me don\u2019t give up their lives, even if they do happen to be gods.\u201d\n\nLlarimar didn\u2019t reply.\n\u201cThe good ones are all already dead, Scoot,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cCalmseer, Brighthue: those were gods who would give themselves away. The rest of us are selfish. There hasn\u2019t been a petition granted in what, three years?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout that, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said quietly.\n\n\u201cAnd why should it be otherwise?\u201d Lightsong said, laughing a bit. \u201cI mean, we have to die to heal one of them. Doesn\u2019t that strike you as ridiculous? What kind of religion encourages its members to come and petition for their god\u2019s life?\u201d Lightsong shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic. We\u2019re gods to them only until they kill us. And I think I might know why the gods give in. It\u2019s those petitions, being forced to sit day after day, knowing that you could save one of them\u2014that you probably should, since your life isn\u2019t really worth anything. That\u2019s enough to drive a man mad. Enough to drive him to kill himself!\u201d\n\nHe smiled, glancing at his high priest. \u201cSuicide by divine manifestation. Very dramatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I call off the rest of the petitions, Your Grace?\u201d Llarimar gave no sign of being annoyed by the outburst.\n\n\u201cSure, why not,\u201d Lightsong said, waving a hand. \u201cThey really need a lesson in theology. They should already know what a useless god I am. Send them away, tell them to come back tomorrow\u2014 assuming that they are foolish enough to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said, bowing.\n\nDoesn\u2019t that man ever get mad at me? Lightsong thought. He, more than any, should know that I\u2019m not a person to rely upon!\n\nLightsong turned, walking away as Llarimar went back into the petition room. No servants tried to follow him. Lightsong pushed his way through red-hued room after red-hued room, eventually finding his way to a stairwell and climbing up to the second story. This floor was open on all sides, really nothing more than a large covered patio. He walked to the far side\u2014the one opposite the line of people.\n\nThe breeze was strong here. He felt it plucking at his robes, bringing with it scents that had traveled hundreds of miles, crossed the ocean, twisting around palm trees and finally entering the Court of Gods. He stood there for a long time, looking out over the city, toward the sea beyond. He had no desire, despite what he sometimes said, to leave his comfortable home in the court. He was not a man of jungles; he was a man of parties.\n\nBut sometimes he wished that he could at least want to be something else. Blushweaver\u2019s words still weighed upon him. You\u2019ll have to stand for something eventually, Lightsong. You\u2019re a god to these people. . . .\n\nHe was. Whether he wanted to be or not. That was the frustrating part. He\u2019d tried his best to be useless and vain. And still they came.\n\nWe could use your confidence . . . you\u2019re a better man than you give yourself credit for being.\n\nWhy did it seem that the more he demonstrated himself to be an idiot, the more convinced people became that he had some kind of hidden depths? By implication, they called him a liar in the same\nbreath that they complimented his presumed inner virtue. Did no one understand that a man could be both likable and useless? Not every quick-tongued fool was a hero in disguise.\n\nHis life sense alerted him of Llarimar\u2019s return long before footsteps did. The priest walked up to join Lightsong alongside the wall. Llarimar rested his arms on the railing\u2014which, being built for a god, was about a foot too high for the priest.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re gone,\u201d Llarimar said.\n\n\u201cAh, very good,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cI do believe that we\u2019ve accomplished something today. I\u2019ve fled from my responsibilities, screamed at my servants, and sat about pouting. Undoubtedly, this will convince everyone that I\u2019m even more noble and honorable than they previously assumed. Tomorrow, there will be twice as many petitions, and I shall continue my inexorable march toward utter madness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go mad,\u201d Llarimar said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure I can,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cI just have to concentrate long enough. You see, the great thing about madness is that it\u2019s all in your head.\u201d\n\nLlarimar shook his head. \u201cI see you\u2019ve been restored to your normal humor.\u201d\n\n\u201cScoot, you wound me. My humor is anything but normal.\u201d They stood silently for a few more minutes, Llarimar offering no chastisement or commentary on his god\u2019s actions. Just like a good little priest.\n\nThat made Lightsong think of something. \u201cScoot, you\u2019re my high priest.\u201d \u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d\n\nLightsong sighed. \u201cYou really need to pay attention to the lines I\u2019m feeding you, Scoot. You really should have said something pithy there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI apologize, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust try harder next time. Anyway, you know about theology and that sort of thing, correct?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve studied my share, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, what is the point\u2014religiously\u2014of having gods that can only heal one person, then die? It seems counterproductive to me. Easy way to depopulate your pantheon.\u201d\n\nLlarimar leaned forward, staring out over the city. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, Your Grace. Returned aren\u2019t just gods\u2014they\u2019re men who died, but who decided to come back and offer blessings and knowledge. After all, only one who has died can have anything useful to say about the other side.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing is, Your Grace, Returned aren\u2019t meant to stay. We extend their lives, giving them extra time to bless us. But they\u2019re really only supposed to remain alive as long as it takes them to do what they need to.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeed to?\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cThat seems rather vague.\u201d\nLlarimar shrugged. \u201cReturned have . . . goals. Objectives which are their own. You knew of yours before you decided to come back, but the process of leaping across the Iridescent Wave leaves the memory fragmented. Stay long enough, and you\u2019ll remember what you came to accomplish. The petitions . . . they\u2019re a way of helping you to remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve come back to save one person\u2019s life?\u201d Lightsong said, frowning, but feeling embarrassed. In five years, he\u2019d spent little time studying his own theology. But, well, that was the sort of thing priests were for.\n\n\u201cNot necessarily, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cYou may have come back to save one person. But, more likely, there is information about the future or the afterlife that you felt you needed to share. Or perhaps some great event in which you felt you needed to participate. Remember, it was the heroic way in which you died that gave you the power to Return in the first place. What you are to do might relate to that, somehow.\u201d\n\nLlarimar trailed off slightly, his eyes growing unfocused. \u201cYou saw something, Lightsong. On the other side, the future is visible, like a scroll that stretches into the eternal harmonics of the cosmos. Something you saw\u2014something about the future\u2014worried you. Rather than remaining at peace, you took the opportunity that your brave death afforded you, and you Returned to the world. Determined to fix a problem, share information, or otherwise help those who continued to live.\n\n\u201cSomeday, once you feel that you\u2019ve accomplished your task, you can use the petitions to find someone who deserves your Breath. Then you can continue your journey across the Iridescent Wave. Our job, as your followers, is to provide Breath for you and keep you alive until you can accomplish your goal, whatever it may be. In the meantime, we pray for auguries and blessings, which can be gleaned only from one who has touched the future as you have.\u201d\n\nLightsong didn\u2019t respond immediately. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t believe?\u201d \u201cIn what, Your Grace?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn any of it,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cThat Returned are gods, that these visions are anything more than random inventions of my brain. What if I don\u2019t believe that I had any purpose or plan in Returning?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen maybe that\u2019s what you came back to discover.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo . . . wait. You\u2019re saying that on the other side\u2014where I obviously believed in the other side\u2014I realized that if I Returned I wouldn\u2019t believe in the other side, so I came back with the purpose of discovering faith in the other side, which I only lost because I Returned in the first place?\u201d\n\nLlarimar paused. Then he smiled. \u201cThat last one breaks down a little bit in the face of logic, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, a little bit,\u201d Lightsong said, smiling back. He turned, eyes falling on the God King\u2019s palace, standing like a monument above the other court structures. \u201cWhat do you think of her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new queen?\u201d Llarimar asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t met her, Your Grace. She won\u2019t be presented for another few days.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the person. The implications.\u201d\nLlarimar glanced at him. \u201cYour Grace. That smells of an interest in politics!\u201d\n\n\u201cBlah blah, yes, I know. Lightsong is a hypocrite. I\u2019ll do penance for it later. Now answer the blasted question.\u201d\n\nLlarimar smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think of her, Your Grace. The court of twenty years ago thought bringing a royal daughter here was a good idea.\u201d\n\nYes, Lightsong thought. But that court is gone. The gods had thought melding the royal line back into Hallandren would be a good idea. But those gods\u2014the ones who believed they knew how to deal with the Idrian girl\u2019s arrival\u2014were now dead. They\u2019d left inferior replacements.\n\nIf what Llarimar said was true, then there was something important about the things Lightsong saw. Those visions of war, and the terrible sense of foreboding. For reasons he couldn\u2019t explain, it felt to him like his people were barreling headfirst down a mountain slope, completely ignorant of a bottomless chasm hidden in the cleft of the lands before them.\n\n\u201cThe full Court Assembly meets in judgment tomorrow, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Lightsong said, still looking at the black palace.\n\n\u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cContact Blushweaver. See if I can share a box with her during the judgments. Perhaps she will distract me. You know what a headache politics gives me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get headaches, Your Grace.\u201d\n\nIn the distance, Lightsong could see the rejected petitioners trailing out of the gates, returning to the city, leaving their gods behind. \u201cCould have fooled me,\u201d he said quietly.\n\n\n\nSiri stood in the dark black bedroom, wearing her shift, looking out the window. The God King\u2019s palace was higher than the surrounding wall, and the bedroom faced east. Out over the sea. She watched the distant waves, feeling the heat of the afternoon sun. While she was wearing the thin shift, the warmth was actually pleasant, and it was tempered by a cool breeze blowing in off the ocean. The wind teased her long hair, ruffling the fabric of her shift.\n\nShe should be dead. She had spoken directly to the God King, had sat up and made a demand of him.\n\nShe\u2019d waited all morning for punishment. There had been none.\n\nShe leaned down against the windowsill, arms crossed on the stone, closing her eyes and feeling the sea breeze. A part of her was still aghast at the way she had acted. That part was growing smaller and smaller. I\u2019ve been going about things wrong here, she thought. I\u2019ve let myself be pushed about by my fears and worries.\n\nShe didn\u2019t usually take time to bother with fears and worries. She just did what seemed right. She was beginning to feel that she should have stood up to the God King days ago. Perhaps she wasn\u2019t being cautious enough. Perhaps punishment would still come. However, for the moment, she felt as if she\u2019d accomplished something.\nShe smiled, opening her eyes, and let her hair change to a determined golden yellow.\n\nIt was time to stop being afraid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give it away,\u201d Vivenna said firmly.\n\nShe sat with the mercenaries in Lemex\u2019s home. It was the day after the Breaths had been forced upon her, and she had spent a restless night, letting the mercenaries and the nurse see to the disposal of Lemex\u2019s body. She didn\u2019t remember falling asleep from the exhaustion and stress of the day, but she did remember lying down to rest for a short time in the other upstairs bedroom. When she\u2019d awoken, she\u2019d been surprised to find that the mercenaries were still there. Apparently, they and Parlin had slept downstairs.\n\nA night\u2019s perspective hadn\u2019t helped her much with her problems. She still had all of that filthy Breath, and she still had no idea what she was going to do in Hallandren without Lemex. At least with the Breath, she had an idea of what to do. It could be given away.\n\nThey were in Lemex\u2019s sitting room. Like most places in Hallandren, the room was swollen with colors; the walls were made from thin strips of reedlike wood, stained in bright yellows and greens. Vivenna couldn\u2019t help but notice that she saw each color more vibrantly now. She had a strangely precise sense of color\u2014she could divide its shades and hues, understanding instinctively how close each color was to the ideal. It was like perfect pitch for the eyes.\n\nIt was very, very difficult not to see beauty in the colors.\n\nDenth leaned against the far wall. Tonk Fah lounged on a couch, yawning periodically, his colorful bird perched on his foot. Parlin had gone to stand watch outside.\n\n\u201cGive it away, Princess?\u201d Denth asked.\n\n\u201cThe Breath,\u201d Vivenna said. She sat on a kitchen stool instead of one of the overly plush chairs or couches. \u201cWe will go out and find unfortunate people who have been raped by your culture, their Breath stolen, and I will give each one a Breath.\u201d\n\nDenth shot a glace at Tonk Fah, who simply yawned.\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d Denth said, \u201cyou can\u2019t give Breath away one at a time. You have to give it all away at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncluding your own Breath,\u201d Tonk Fah said.\n\nDenth nodded. \u201cThat would leave you as a Drab.\u201d\n\nVivenna\u2019s stomach churned at that. The thought of not only losing the new beauty and color, but her own Breath, her soul . . . well, it was almost enough to turn her hair white. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option, then.\u201d\n\nThe room fell silent.\n\n\u201cShe could Awaken stuff,\u201d Tonk Fah noted, wiggling his foot, making his bird squawk. \u201cStick the Breath inside of a pair of pants or something.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good point,\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cWhat . . . does that entail?\u201d Vivenna asked.\n\n\u201cYou bring something to life, Princess,\u201d Denth said. \u201cAn inanimate object. That\u2019ll draw out some of your Breath and leave the object kind of alive. Most Awakeners do it temporarily, but I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t just leave the Breath there.\u201d\n\nAwakening. Taking the souls of men and using them to create unliving monstrosities. Somehow, Vivenna felt that Austre would find that an even greater sin than simply bearing the Breath. She sighed, shaking her head. The problem with the Breath was, in a way, just a distraction\u2014one she feared she was using to keep herself from dwelling on the lack of Lemex. What was she going to do?\n\nDenth sat down in a chair beside her, resting his feet on the sitting table. He kept himself better groomed than Tonk Fah, his dark hair pulled back into a neat tail, his face clean-shaven. \u201cI hate being a mercenary,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know why?\u201d\n\nShe raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cNo job security,\u201d Denth said, leaning back in his chair. \u201cThe kinds of things we do, they tend to be dangerous and unpredictable. Our employers have a habit of dying off on us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough usually not from the chills,\u201d Tonk Fah noted. \u201cSwords tend to be the method of choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake our current predicament,\u201d Denth said. \u201cNo more employer. That leaves us without any real direction.\u201d\n\nVivenna froze. Does that mean their contract is over? They know I\u2019m a princess of Idris. What will they do with that information? Is that why they stayed here last night, rather than leaving? Are they planning to blackmail me?\n\nDenth eyed her. \u201cYou see that?\u201d he asked, turning to Tonk Fah.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tonk Fah said. \u201cShe\u2019s thinking it.\u201d\n\nDenth leaned back further in his chair. \u201cThis is exactly what I\u2019m talking about. Why does everyone assume that when a mercenary\u2019s contract is over, he\u2019ll betray them? You think we go around stabbing people for the fun of it? Do you think a surgeon has this problem? Do people worry that the moment they\u2019re done paying him, he\u2019ll laugh maniacally and cut off their toes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like cutting off toes,\u201d Tonk Fah noted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d Denth said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do it simply because your contract ran out, would you?\u201d \u201cNah,\u201d Tonk Fah said. \u201cToes is toes.\u201d\n\nVivenna rolled her eyes. \u201cIs there a point to this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point is, Princess,\u201d Denth said, \u201cyou were just thinking that we were going to betray you. Maybe rob you blind or sell you to slavery or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cI was thinking nothing of the sort.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Denth replied. \u201cMercenary work is very respectable\u2014it\u2019s legal in almost every kingdom I know. We\u2019re just as much a part of the community as the baker or the fishmonger.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that we pay the tax collectors,\u201d Tonk Fah added. \u201cWe tend to stab them for the fun of it.\u201d Vivenna just shook her head.\n\nDenth leaned forward, speaking in a more serious tone. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say, Princess, is that we\u2019re not criminals. We\u2019re employees. Your friend Lemex was our boss. Now he\u2019s dead. I figure that our contract transfers to you now, if you want it.\u201d\n\nVivenna felt a slight glimmer of hope. But could she trust them? Despite Denth\u2019s speech, she found it hard to have faith in the motives and altruism of a pair of men who fought for money. However, they hadn\u2019t taken advantage of Lemex\u2019s sickness, and they had stayed around even after they could have robbed the place and left while she was asleep.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cHow much is left on your contract?\u201d \u201cNo idea,\u201d Denth said. \u201cJewels handles that kind of thing.\u201d \u201cJewels?\u201d Vivenna asked.\n\u201cThird member of the group,\u201d Tonk Fah said. \u201cShe\u2019s off doing Jewels stuff.\u201d Vivenna frowned. \u201cHow many of you are there?\u201d \u201cJust three,\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cUnless you count pets,\u201d Tonk Fah said, balancing his bird on his foot.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be back in a while,\u201d Denth said. \u201cShe stopped in last night, but you were asleep. Anyway, I know we\u2019ve got at least a few months left on our contract, and we were paid half up front. Even if you decide not to pay the rest, we probably owe you a few more weeks.\u201d\n\nTonk Fah nodded. \u201cSo if there\u2019s anyone you want killed, now would be the time.\u201d Vivenna stared, and Tonk Fah chuckled.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really going to have to get used to our terrible senses of humor, Princess,\u201d Denth said. \u201cAssuming, of course, you\u2019re going to keep us around.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already implied that I\u2019ll keep you,\u201d Vivenna said.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Denth replied. \u201cBut what are you going to do with us? Why did you even come to the city?\u201d\n\nVivenna didn\u2019t answer immediately. No point in holding back, she thought. They know the most dangerous secret\u2014my identity\u2014already. \u201cI\u2019m here to rescue my sister,\u201d she said. \u201cTo sneak her out of the God King\u2019s palace and see her returned to Idris unharmed.\u201d\n\nThe mercenaries fell silent. Finally, Tonk Fah whistled. \u201cAmbitious,\u201d he noted as his parrot mimicked the whistle.\n\n\u201cShe is a princess,\u201d Denth said. \u201cThey tend to be ambitious sorts.\u201d\n\u201cSiri isn\u2019t ready to deal with Hallandren,\u201d Vivenna said, leaning forward. \u201cMy father sent her in my place, but I cannot stand the thought of her serving as the God King\u2019s wife. Unfortunately, if we simply grab her and go, Hallandren will likely attack my homeland. We need to make her disappear in a way that isn\u2019t traceable to my people. If necessary, we can substitute me for my sister.\u201d\n\nDenth scratched his head.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Vivenna asked.\n\n\u201cLittle bit out of our realm of expertise,\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cWe usually hit things,\u201d Tonk Fah said.\n\nDenth nodded. \u201cOr, at least, keep things from getting hit. Lemex kept us on partially just as bodyguards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he just send for a couple of Idrian soldiers to protect him?\u201d Denth and Tonk Fah exchanged a look.\n\n\u201cHow can I put this delicately?\u201d Denth said. \u201cPrincess, your Lemex was embezzling money from the king and spending it on Breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cLemex was a patriot!\u201d Vivenna said immediately.\n\n\u201cThat may have been the case,\u201d Denth said. \u201cBut even a good priest isn\u2019t above slipping himself a few coins out of the coffer, so to speak. I think your Lemex figured it would be better to have outside muscle, rather than inside loyalists, protecting him.\u201d\n\nVivenna fell silent. It was still hard to imagine the thoughtful, clever, and passionate man represented in Lemex\u2019s letters as a thief. Yet it was also hard to imagine Lemex holding as much Breath as he obviously had.\n\nBut embezzling? Stealing from Idris itself?\n\n\u201cYou learn things as a mercenary,\u201d Denth said, resting back with hands behind his head. \u201cYou fight enough people, and you figure you start to understand them. You stay alive by anticipating them. The thing is, people aren\u2019t simple. Even Idrians.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoring, yes,\u201d Tonk Fah added. \u201cBut not simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Lemex, he was involved in some big plans,\u201d Denth said. \u201cI honestly think he was a patriot. There are many intrigues going on in this city, Princess\u2014some of the projects Lemex had us working on had a grand scope, and were for the good of Idris, as near as I can tell. I guess he just thought he should be compensated a little for his patriotism.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite an amiable fellow, actually,\u201d Tonk Fah said. \u201cDidn\u2019t want to bother your father. So he just did the figures on his own, gave himself a raise, and indicated in his reports that his costs were far greater than they really were.\u201d\n\nVivenna fell silent, letting herself digest the words. How could anyone who stole money from Idris also be a patriot? How could a person faithful to Austre end up with several hundred BioChromatic Breaths?\nShe shook her head wryly. I saw men who placed themselves above others, and I saw them cast down, she quoted to herself. It was one of the Five Visions. She shouldn\u2019t judge Lemex, particularly now that he was dead. \u201cWait,\u201d she said, eyeing the mercenaries. \u201cYou said that you were just bodyguards. What, then, were you doing helping Lemex with \u2018projects\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe two men shared a look.\n\n\u201cTold you she was smart,\u201d Tonk Fah said. \u201cComes from not being a mercenary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are bodyguards, Princess,\u201d Denth said. \u201cHowever, we\u2019re not without certain . . . skills. We can make things happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThings?\u201d Vivenna asked.\n\nDenth shrugged. \u201cWe know people. That\u2019s part of what makes us useful. Let me think about this issue with your sister. Maybe I\u2019ll be able to come up with some ideas. It\u2019s a little like kidnapping. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich,\u201d Tonk Fah said, \u201cwe\u2019re not too fond of. Did we mention that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cBad business. No money. What were these \u2018projects\u2019 Lemex was working on?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure of the whole of them,\u201d Denth admitted. \u201cWe only saw pieces\u2014running errands, arranging meetings, intimidating people. It had something to do with work for your father. We can find out for you, if you want.\u201d\n\nVivenna nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\nDenth stood. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said. He walked past Tonk Fah\u2019s couch, smacking the larger man\u2019s leg, causing the bird to squawk. \u201cTonk. Come on. Time to ransack the house.\u201d\n\nTonk Fah yawned and sat up.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cRansack the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Denth said, heading up the stairs. \u201cBreak out any hidden safes. Search through papers and files. Figure out what old Lemex was up to.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t care much,\u201d Tonk Fah said, standing. \u201cBeing dead and all.\u201d\n\nVivenna shivered. She still wished she\u2019d been able to see that Lemex got a proper Idrian burial, rather than sending him off to the Hallandren charnel house. Having a pair of toughs search his belongings felt unseemly.\n\nDenth must have noticed her discomfort. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to, if you don\u2019t want us to.\u201d \u201cSure,\u201d Tonk Fah said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know what Lemex was up to, though.\u201d \u201cContinue,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to supervise.\u201d \u201cActually, I doubt that you will,\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Denth said. \u201cNow, I know nobody ever asks mercenaries for their opinion. You see\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, just get on with it,\u201d Vivenna said with annoyance, though she immediately chastised herself for her snappishness. What was wrong with her? The last few days must be wearing on her.\n\nDenth just smiled, as if he found her outburst incredibly amusing. \u201cToday\u2019s the day when the Returned hold their Court Assembly, Princess.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Vivenna asked with forced calmness.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Denth replied, \u201cit\u2019s also the day when your sister will be presented to the gods. I suspect that you\u2019ll want to go get a good look at her, see how she\u2019s holding up. If you\u2019re going to do that, you\u2019ll want to get moving. Court Assembly will begin pretty soon.\u201d\n\nVivenna folded her arms, not moving. \u201cI\u2019ve been tutored all about these things, Denth. Regular people can\u2019t just walk into the Court of Gods. If you want to watch the judgments at the Court Assembly, you either have to be favored of one of the gods, be extremely influential, or you have to draw and win the lottery.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Denth said, leaning against the banister. \u201cIf only we knew someone with enough BioChromatic Breaths to instantly be considered important, and therefore gain entrance to the court without being questioned.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, Denth,\u201d Tonk Fah said. \u201cSomeone has to have at least fifty Breaths to be considered worthy! That\u2019s a terribly high number.\u201d\n\nVivenna paused. \u201cAnd . . . how many Breaths do I have?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, around five hundred or so,\u201d Denth said. \u201cAt least, that\u2019s what Lemex claimed. I\u2019m inclined to believe him. You are, after all, making the carpet shine.\u201d\n\nShe glanced down, noticing for the first time that she was creating a pocket of enhanced color around her. It wasn\u2019t very distinct, but it was noticeable.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better get going, Princess,\u201d Denth said, continuing to clomp up the stairs. \u201cYou\u2019ll be late.\u201d\n\n\n\nSiri sat nervously, blond with excitement, trying to contain herself as the serving women did her hair. Her Wedding Jubilation\u2014something she found rather inappropriately named\u2014was finally over, and it was time for her formal presenta tion before the Hallandren gods.\n\nShe was probably too excited. It hadn\u2019t really been that long. Yet the prospect of finally leaving\u2014if only to attend court\u2014made her almost giddy. She would finally get to interact with someone other than priests, scribes, and servants. She\u2019d finally get to meet some of those gods that she\u2019d heard so much about.\n\nPlus, he\u2019d be there at the presenta tion. The only times she\u2019d been able to see the God King had been during their nightly staring matches, when he was shrouded in shadow. Today, she would at last see him in the light.\n\nShe smiled, inspecting herself in a large mirror. The servants had done her hair in an amazingly intricate style, part of it braided, the rest allowed to flow free. They\u2019d tied several ribbons into the\nbraids and also woven them into her free-flowing hair. The ribbons shimmered as she turned her head. Her family would have been mortified at the ostentatious colors. Siri grinned mischievously, making her hair turn a brighter shade of golden blond to better contrast with the ribbons.\n\nThe serving women smiled approvingly, a couple letting out quiet \u201cooo\u201ds at the transformation. Siri sat back, hands in her lap as she inspected her clothing choices for the court appearance. The garments were ornate\u2014not as complex as the ones she wore to the bedchambers, but far more formal than her everyday choices.\n\nRed was the theme for the serving women and priests today. That made Siri want to choose something else. Eventually, she decided on gold, and she pointed at the two golden gowns, having the women bring them forward so she could look at them more closely. Unfortunately, as she did so, the women fetched three more golden dresses from a rolling wardrobe out in the hallway.\n\nSiri sighed. It was as if they were determined to keep her from having a reasonably simple choice. She just hated seeing so many options disappear each day. If only . . .\n\nShe paused. \u201cCould I try them all on?\u201d\n\nThe serving women glanced at each other, a little confused. They nodded toward her, their expressions conveying a simple message. Of course you can. Siri felt foolish, but in Idris she\u2019d never had a choice before. She smiled, standing and letting them take off her robe and then dress her in the first of the gowns, careful not to mess up her hair. Siri inspected herself, noting that the neckline was rather low. She was willing to splurge on color, but the amount of flesh the Hallandren showed still felt scandalous.\n\nShe nodded, letting them take off the gown. Then they dressed her in the next one\u2014a two-piece garment with a separate corset. Once they were finished, Siri eyed this new outfit in the mirror. She liked it, but she wanted to try the others as well. So, after spinning about and inspecting the back, she nodded and moved on.\n\nIt was frivolous. But why was she so worried about being frivolous? Her father wasn\u2019t around to regard her with that stern, disapproving face of his. Vivenna was an entire kingdom away. Siri was queen of the Hallandren people. Shouldn\u2019t she try to learn their ways? She smiled at the ridiculous justification, but went on to the next gown anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s raining,\u201d Lightsong noted.\n\n\u201cVery astute, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said, walking beside his god.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not fond of rain.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you have often noted, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a god,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I have power over the weather? How can it rain if I don\u2019t want it to?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are currently twenty-five gods in the court, Your Grace. Perhaps there are more who desire rain than those who don\u2019t.\u201d\nLightsong\u2019s robes of gold and red rustled as he walked. The grass was cool and damp beneath his sandaled toes, but a group of servants carried a wide canopy over him. Rain fell softly on the cloth. In T\u2019Telir, rainfalls were common, but they were never very strong.\n\nLightsong would have liked to have seen a true rainstorm, like people said occurred out in the jungles. \u201cI\u2019ll take a poll then,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cOf the other gods. See how many of them wanted it to rain today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you wish, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cIt won\u2019t prove much.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll prove whose fault this is,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cAnd . . . if it turns out that most of us want it to stop raining, perhaps that will start a theological crisis.\u201d\n\nLlarimar, of course, didn\u2019t seem bothered by the concept of a god trying to undermine his own religion. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, \u201cour doctrine is quite sound, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if the gods don\u2019t want it to rain, yet it still does?\u201d \u201cWould you like it to be sunny all the time, Your Grace?\u201d Lightsong shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the farmers?\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cTheir crops would die without the rain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can rain on the crops,\u201d Lightsong said, \u201cjust not in the city. A few selective weather patterns shouldn\u2019t be too much for a god to accomplish.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people need water to drink, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cThe streets need to be washed clean. And what of the plants in the city? The beautiful trees\u2014even this grass that you enjoy walking across \u2014would die if the rain did not fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Lightsong said, \u201cI could just will them to continue living.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is what you do, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cYour soul knows that rain is best for the city, and so it rains. Despite what your consciousness thinks.\u201d\n\nLightsong frowned. \u201cBy that argument, you could claim that anyone was a god, Llarimar.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot just anyone comes back from the dead, Your Grace. Nor do they have the power to heal the sick, and they certainly don\u2019t have your ability to foresee the future.\u201d\n\nGood points, those, Lightsong thought as they approached the arena. The large, circular structure was at the back of the Court of Gods, outside of the ring of palaces that surrounded the courtyard. Lightsong\u2019s entourage moved inside\u2014red canopy still held above him\u2014and entered the sand-covered arena yard. Then they moved up a ramp toward the seating area.\n\nThe arena had four rows of seats for ordinary people\u2014stone benches, accommodating T\u2019Telir citizens who were favored, lucky, or rich enough to get themselves into an assembly session. The upper reaches of the arena were reserved for the Returned. Here\u2014close enough to hear what was said on the arena floor, yet far enough back to remain stately\u2014were the boxes. Ornately carved in stone, they were large enough to hold a god\u2019s entire entourage.\nLightsong could see that several of his colleagues had arrived, marked by the colorful canopies that sat above their boxes. Lifeblesser was there, as was Mercystar. They passed by the empty box usually reserved for Lightsong and made their way around the ring and approached a box topped by a green pavilion. Blushweaver lounged inside. Her green and silver dress was lavish and re vealing, as always. Despite its rich trim and embroidery, it was little more than a long swath of cloth with a hole in the center for her head and some ties. That left it completely open on both sides from shoulder to calf, and Blushweaver\u2019s thighs curved out lusciously on either side. She sat up, smiling.\n\nLightsong took a deep breath. Blushweaver always treated him kindly and she certainly did have a high opinion of him, but he felt like he had to be on guard at all times when he was around her. A man could be taken in by a woman such as she.\n\nTaken in, then never released.\n\n\u201cLightsong, dear,\u201d she said, smiling more deeply as Lightsong\u2019s servants scuttled forward, setting up his chair, footrest, and snack table.\n\n\u201cBlushweaver,\u201d Lightsong replied. \u201cMy high priest tells me that you\u2019re to blame for this dreary weather.\u201d\n\nBlushweaver raised an eyebrow, and to the side\u2014standing with the other priests\u2014Llarimar flushed. \u201cI like the rain,\u201d Blushweaver finally said, lounging back on her couch. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . different. I like things that are different.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you should be thoroughly bored by me, my dear,\u201d Lightsong said, seating himself and taking a handful of grapes\u2014already peeled\u2014from the bowl on his snack table.\n\n\u201cBored?\u201d Blushweaver asked.\n\n\u201cI strive for nothing if not mediocrity, and mediocrity is hardly different. In fact, I should say that it\u2019s highly in fashion in court these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say such things,\u201d Blushweaver said. \u201cThe people might start to believe you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mistake me. That\u2019s why I say them. I figure if I can\u2019t do properly deific miracles like control the weather, then I might as well settle for the lesser miracle of being the one who tells the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHum,\u201d she replied, stretching back, the tips of her fingers wiggling as she sighed in contentment. \u201cOur priests say that the purpose of the gods is not to play with weather or prevent disasters, but to provide visions and ser vice to the people. Perhaps this attitude of yours is not the best way to see to their interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cI\u2019ve just had a revelation. Mediocrity isn\u2019t the best way to serve our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cMedium rare on a bed of sweet-potato medallions,\u201d he said, popping a grape in his mouth. \u201cWith a slight garnish of garlic and a light white wine sauce.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re incorrigible,\u201d she said, finishing her stretch.\n\u201cI am what the universe made me to be, my dear.\u201d \u201cYou bow before the whims of the universe, then?\u201d \u201cWhat else would I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cFight it,\u201d Blushweaver said. She narrowed her eyes, absently reaching to take one of the grapes from Lightsong\u2019s hand. \u201cFight with everything, force the universe to bow to you instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a charming concept, Blushweaver. But I believe that the universe and I are in slightly different weight categories.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m fat?\u201d\n\nShe regarded him with a flat glance. \u201cI\u2019m saying that you needn\u2019t be so humble, Lightsong. You\u2019re\n\n    \u2022 god.\u201d\n\n\u201cA god who can\u2019t even make it stop raining.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want it to storm and tempest. Maybe this drizzle is the compromise between us.\u201d\n\nLightsong popped another grape in his mouth, squishing it between his teeth, feeling the sweet juice leak onto his palate. He thought for a moment, chewing. \u201cBlushweaver, dear,\u201d he finally said. \u201cIs there some kind of subtext to our current conversation? Because, as you might know, I am\n\nabsolutely terrible with subtext. It gives me a headache.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t get headaches,\u201d Blushweaver said.\n\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t get subtext either. Far too subtle for me. It takes effort to understand, and effort is\u2014 unfortunately\u2014against my religion.\u201d\n\nBlushweaver raised an eyebrow. \u201cA new tenet for those who worship you?\u201d\n"], "title": ["Warbreaker"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson"]}
