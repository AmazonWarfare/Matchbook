I am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life\namongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain.\n\n\n_Lucy Westenra's Diary._\n\n_17 September._--Four days and nights of peace. I am getting so strong\nagain that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some\nlong nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and\nfeel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim\nhalf-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness\nin which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress\nmore poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to\nlife as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since,\nhowever, Dr. Van Helsing has been with me, all this bad dreaming seems\nto have passed away; the noises that used to frighten me out of my\nwits--the flapping against the windows, the distant voices which seemed\nso close to me, the harsh sounds that came from I know not where and\ncommanded me to do I know not what--have all ceased. I go to bed now\nwithout any fear of sleep. I do not even try to keep awake. I have grown\nquite fond of the garlic, and a boxful arrives for me every day from\nHaarlem. To-night Dr. Van Helsing is going away, as he has to be for a\nday in Amsterdam. But I need not be watched; I am well enough to be left\nalone. Thank God for mother's sake, and dear Arthur's, and for all our\nfriends who have been so kind! I shall not even feel the change, for\nlast night Dr. Van Helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time. I found\nhim asleep twice when I awoke; but I did not fear to go to sleep again,\nalthough the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against\nthe window-panes.\n\n\n_\"The Pall Mall Gazette,\" 18 September._\n\n                           THE ESCAPED WOLF.\n\n         PERILOUS ADVENTURE OF OUR INTERVIEWER.\n\n         _Interview with the Keeper in the Zo\u00f6logical Gardens._\n\nAfter many inquiries and almost as many refusals, and perpetually using\nthe words \"Pall Mall Gazette\" as a sort of talisman, I managed to find\nthe keeper of the section of the Zo\u00f6logical Gardens in which the wolf\ndepartment is included. Thomas Bilder lives in one of the cottages in\nthe enclosure behind the elephant-house, and was just sitting down to\nhis tea when I found him. Thomas and his wife are hospitable folk,\nelderly, and without children, and if the specimen I enjoyed of their\nhospitality be of the average kind, their lives must be pretty\ncomfortable. The keeper would not enter on what he called \"business\"\nuntil the supper was over, and we were all satisfied. Then when the\ntable was cleared, and he had lit his pipe, he said:--\n\n\"Now, sir, you can go on and arsk me what you want. You'll excoose me\nrefoosin' to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals. I gives the\nwolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore\nI begins to arsk them questions.\"\n\n\"How do you mean, ask them questions?\" I queried, wishful to get him\ninto a talkative humour.\n\n\"'Ittin' of them over the 'ead with a pole is one way; scratchin' of\ntheir hears is another, when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show-orf\nto their gals. I don't so much mind the fust--the 'ittin' with a pole\nafore I chucks in their dinner; but I waits till they've 'ad their\nsherry and kawffee, so to speak, afore I tries on with the\near-scratchin'. Mind you,\" he added philosophically, \"there's a deal of\nthe same nature in us as in them theer animiles. Here's you a-comin' and\narskin' of me questions about my business, and I that grumpy-like that\nonly for your bloomin' 'arf-quid I'd 'a' seen you blowed fust 'fore I'd\nanswer. Not even when you arsked me sarcastic-like if I'd like you to\narsk the Superintendent if you might arsk me questions. Without offence\ndid I tell yer to go to 'ell?\"\n\n\"You did.\"\n\n\"An' when you said you'd report me for usin' of obscene language that\nwas 'ittin' me over the 'ead; but the 'arf-quid made that all right. I\nweren't a-goin' to fight, so I waited for the food, and did with my 'owl\nas the wolves, and lions, and tigers does. But, Lor' love yer 'art, now\nthat the old 'ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea-cake in me, an' rinsed\nme out with her bloomin' old teapot, and I've lit hup, you may scratch\nmy ears for all you're worth, and won't git even a growl out of me.\nDrive along with your questions. I know what yer a-comin' at, that 'ere\nescaped wolf.\"\n\n\"Exactly. I want you to give me your view of it. Just tell me how it\nhappened; and when I know the facts I'll get you to say what you\nconsider was the cause of it, and how you think the whole affair will\nend.\"\n\n\"All right, guv'nor. This 'ere is about the 'ole story. That 'ere wolf\nwhat we called Bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from\nNorway to Jamrach's, which we bought off him four years ago. He was a\nnice well-behaved wolf, that never gave no trouble to talk of. I'm more\nsurprised at 'im for wantin' to get out nor any other animile in the\nplace. But, there, you can't trust wolves no more nor women.\"\n\n\"Don't you mind him, sir!\" broke in Mrs. Tom, with a cheery laugh. \"'E's\ngot mindin' the animiles so long that blest if he ain't like a old wolf\n'isself! But there ain't no 'arm in 'im.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, it was about two hours after feedin' yesterday when I first\nhear my disturbance. I was makin' up a litter in the monkey-house for a\nyoung puma which is ill; but when I heard the yelpin' and 'owlin' I kem\naway straight. There was Bersicker a-tearin' like a mad thing at the\nbars as if he wanted to get out. There wasn't much people about that\nday, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a 'ook\nnose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin' through it. He\nhad a 'ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him,\nfor it seemed as if it was 'im as they was hirritated at. He 'ad white\nkid gloves on 'is 'ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:\n'Keeper, these wolves seem upset at something.'\n\n\"'Maybe it's you,' says I, for I did not like the airs as he give\n'isself. He didn't git angry, as I 'oped he would, but he smiled a kind\nof insolent smile, with a mouth full of white, sharp teeth. 'Oh no, they\nwouldn't like me,' 'e says.\n\n\"'Ow yes, they would,' says I, a-imitatin' of him. 'They always likes a\nbone or two to clean their teeth on about tea-time, which you 'as a\nbagful.'\n\n\"Well, it was a odd thing, but when the animiles see us a-talkin' they\nlay down, and when I went over to Bersicker he let me stroke his ears\nsame as ever. That there man kem over, and blessed but if he didn't put\nin his hand and stroke the old wolf's ears too!\n\n\"'Tyke care,' says I. 'Bersicker is quick.'\n\n\"'Never mind,' he says. 'I'm used to 'em!'\n\n\"'Are you in the business yourself?' I says, tyking off my 'at, for a\nman what trades in wolves, anceterer, is a good friend to keepers.\n\n\"'No' says he, 'not exactly in the business, but I 'ave made pets of\nseveral.' And with that he lifts his 'at as perlite as a lord, and walks\naway. Old Bersicker kep' a-lookin' arter 'im till 'e was out of sight,\nand then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn't come hout the 'ole\nhevening. Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves\nhere all began a-'owling. There warn't nothing for them to 'owl at.\nThere warn't no one near, except some one that was evidently a-callin' a\ndog somewheres out back of the gardings in the Park road. Once or twice\nI went out to see that all was right, and it was, and then the 'owling\nstopped. Just before twelve o'clock I just took a look round afore\nturnin' in, an', bust me, but when I kem opposite to old Bersicker's\ncage I see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty. And\nthat's all I know for certing.\"\n\n\"Did any one else see anything?\"\n\n\"One of our gard'ners was a-comin' 'ome about that time from a 'armony,\nwhen he sees a big grey dog comin' out through the garding 'edges. At\nleast, so he says, but I don't give much for it myself, for if he did 'e\nnever said a word about it to his missis when 'e got 'ome, and it was\nonly after the escape of the wolf was made known, and we had been up all\nnight-a-huntin' of the Park for Bersicker, that he remembered seein'\nanything. My own belief was that the 'armony 'ad got into his 'ead.\"\n\n\"Now, Mr. Bilder, can you account in any way for the escape of the\nwolf?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" he said, with a suspicious sort of modesty, \"I think I can;\nbut I don't know as 'ow you'd be satisfied with the theory.\"\n\n\"Certainly I shall. If a man like you, who knows the animals from\nexperience, can't hazard a good guess at any rate, who is even to try?\"\n\n\"Well then, sir, I accounts for it this way; it seems to me that 'ere\nwolf escaped--simply because he wanted to get out.\"\n\nFrom the hearty way that both Thomas and his wife laughed at the joke I\ncould see that it had done service before, and that the whole\nexplanation was simply an elaborate sell. I couldn't cope in badinage\nwith the worthy Thomas, but I thought I knew a surer way to his heart,\nso I said:--\n\n\"Now, Mr. Bilder, we'll consider that first half-sovereign worked off,\nand this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've told me\nwhat you think will happen.\"\n\n\"Right y'are, sir,\" he said briskly. \"Ye'll excoose me, I know, for\na-chaffin' of ye, but the old woman here winked at me, which was as much\nas telling me to go on.\"\n\n\"Well, I never!\" said the old lady.\n\n\"My opinion is this: that 'ere wolf is a-'idin' of, somewheres. The\ngard'ner wot didn't remember said he was a-gallopin' northward faster\nthan a horse could go; but I don't believe him, for, yer see, sir,\nwolves don't gallop no more nor dogs does, they not bein' built that\nway. Wolves is fine things in a storybook, and I dessay when they gets\nin packs and does be chivyin' somethin' that's more afeared than they is\nthey can make a devil of a noise and chop it up, whatever it is. But,\nLor' bless you, in real life a wolf is only a low creature, not half so\nclever or bold as a good dog; and not half a quarter so much fight in\n'im. This one ain't been used to fightin' or even to providin' for\nhisself, and more like he's somewhere round the Park a-'idin' an'\na-shiverin' of, and, if he thinks at all, wonderin' where he is to get\nhis breakfast from; or maybe he's got down some area and is in a\ncoal-cellar. My eye, won't some cook get a rum start when she sees his\ngreen eyes a-shining at her out of the dark! If he can't get food he's\nbound to look for it, and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher's\nshop in time. If he doesn't, and some nursemaid goes a-walkin' orf with\na soldier, leavin' of the hinfant in the perambulator--well, then I\nshouldn't be surprised if the census is one babby the less. That's\nall.\"\n\nI was handing him the half-sovereign, when something came bobbing up\nagainst the window, and Mr. Bilder's face doubled its natural length\nwith surprise.\n\n\"God bless me!\" he said. \"If there ain't old Bersicker come back by\n'isself!\"\n\nHe went to the door and opened it; a most unnecessary proceeding it\nseemed to me. I have always thought that a wild animal never looks so\nwell as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us; a\npersonal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea.\n\nAfter all, however, there is nothing like custom, for neither Bilder nor\nhis wife thought any more of the wolf than I should of a dog. The animal\nitself was as peaceful and well-behaved as that father of all\npicture-wolves--Red Riding Hood's quondam friend, whilst moving her\nconfidence in masquerade.\n\nThe whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos. The\nwicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed London and set all the\nchildren in the town shivering in their shoes, was there in a sort of\npenitent mood, and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine\nprodigal son. Old Bilder examined him all over with most tender\nsolicitude, and when he had finished with his penitent said:--\n\n\"There, I knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble;\ndidn't I say it all along? Here's his head all cut and full of broken\nglass. 'E's been a-gettin' over some bloomin' wall or other. It's a\nshyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles.\nThis 'ere's what comes of it. Come along, Bersicker.\"\n\nHe took the wolf and locked him up in a cage, with a piece of meat that\nsatisfied, in quantity at any rate, the elementary conditions of the\nfatted calf, and went off to report.\n\nI came off, too, to report the only exclusive information that is given\nto-day regarding the strange escapade at the Zoo.\n\n\n_Dr. Seward's Diary._\n\n_17 September._--I was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my\nbooks, which, through press of other work and the many visits to Lucy,\nhad fallen sadly into arrear. Suddenly the door was burst open, and in\nrushed my patient, with his face distorted with passion. I was\nthunderstruck, for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord\ninto the Superintendent's study is almost unknown. Without an instant's\npause he made straight at me. He had a dinner-knife in his hand, and,\nas I saw he was dangerous, I tried to keep the table between us. He was\ntoo quick and too strong for me, however; for before I could get my\nbalance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely.\nBefore he could strike again, however, I got in my right and he was\nsprawling on his back on the floor. My wrist bled freely, and quite a\nlittle pool trickled on to the carpet. I saw that my friend was not\nintent on further effort, and occupied myself binding up my wrist,\nkeeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time. When the\nattendants rushed in, and we turned our attention to him, his employment\npositively sickened me. He was lying on his belly on the floor licking\nup, like a dog, the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist. He was\neasily secured, and, to my surprise, went with the attendants quite\nplacidly, simply repeating over and over again: \"The blood is the life!\nThe blood is the life!\"\n\nI cannot afford to lose blood just at present; I have lost too much of\nlate for my physical good, and then the prolonged strain of Lucy's\nillness and its horrible phases is telling on me. I am over-excited and\nweary, and I need rest, rest, rest. Happily Van Helsing has not summoned\nme, so I need not forego my sleep; to-night I could not well do without\nit.\n\n\n_Telegram, Van Helsing, Antwerp, to Seward, Carfax._\n\n(Sent to Carfax, Sussex, as no county given; delivered late by\ntwenty-two hours.)\n\n\"_17 September._--Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night. If not\nwatching all the time frequently, visit and see that flowers are as\nplaced; very important; do not fail. Shall be with you as soon as\npossible after arrival.\"\n\n\n_Dr. Seward's Diary._\n\n_18 September._--Just off for train to London. The arrival of Van\nHelsing's telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know\nby bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is\npossible that all may be well, but what _may_ have happened? Surely\nthere is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident\nshould thwart us in all we try to do. I shall take this cylinder with\nme, and then I can complete my entry on Lucy's phonograph.\n\n\n_Memorandum left by Lucy Westenra._\n\n_17 September. Night._--I write this and leave it to be seen, so that no\none may by any chance get into trouble through me. This is an exact\nrecord of what took place to-night. I feel I am dying of weakness, and\nhave barely strength to write, but it must be done if I die in the\ndoing.\n\nI went to bed as usual, taking care that the flowers were placed as Dr.\nVan Helsing directed, and soon fell asleep.\n\nI was waked by the flapping at the window, which had begun after that\nsleep-walking on the cliff at Whitby when Mina saved me, and which now I\nknow so well. I was not afraid, but I did wish that Dr. Seward was in\nthe next room--as Dr. Van Helsing said he would be--so that I might have\ncalled him. I tried to go to sleep, but could not. Then there came to me\nthe old fear of sleep, and I determined to keep awake. Perversely sleep\nwould try to come then when I did not want it; so, as I feared to be\nalone, I opened my door and called out: \"Is there anybody there?\" There\nwas no answer. I was afraid to wake mother, and so closed my door again.\nThen outside in the shrubbery I heard a sort of howl like a dog's, but\nmore fierce and deeper. I went to the window and looked out, but could\nsee nothing, except a big bat, which had evidently been buffeting its\nwings against the window. So I went back to bed again, but determined\nnot to go to sleep. Presently the door opened, and mother looked in;\nseeing by my moving that I was not asleep, came in, and sat by me. She\nsaid to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont:--\n\n\"I was uneasy about you, darling, and came in to see that you were all\nright.\"\n\nI feared she might catch cold sitting there, and asked her to come in\nand sleep with me, so she came into bed, and lay down beside me; she did\nnot take off her dressing gown, for she said she would only stay a while\nand then go back to her own bed. As she lay there in my arms, and I in\nhers, the flapping and buffeting came to the window again. She was\nstartled and a little frightened, and cried out: \"What is that?\" I tried\nto pacify her, and at last succeeded, and she lay quiet; but I could\nhear her poor dear heart still beating terribly. After a while there was\nthe low howl again out in the shrubbery, and shortly after there was a\ncrash at the window, and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor.\nThe window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in, and in the\naperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great, gaunt grey\nwolf. Mother cried out in a fright, and struggled up into a sitting\nposture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst\nother things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing\ninsisted on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a\nsecond or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange\nand horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over--as if struck\nwith lightning, and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a\nmoment or two. The room and all round seemed to spin round. I kept my\neyes fixed on the window, but the wolf drew his head back, and a whole\nmyriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken\nwindow, and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that\ntravellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert. I tried to\nstir, but there was some spell upon me, and dear mother's poor body,\nwhich seemed to grow cold already--for her dear heart had ceased to\nbeat--weighed me down; and I remembered no more for a while.\n\nThe time did not seem long, but very, very awful, till I recovered\nconsciousness again. Somewhere near, a passing bell was tolling; the\ndogs all round the neighbourhood were howling; and in our shrubbery,\nseemingly just outside, a nightingale was singing. I was dazed and\nstupid with pain and terror and weakness, but the sound of the\nnightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort\nme. The sounds seemed to have awakened the maids, too, for I could hear\ntheir bare feet pattering outside my door. I called to them, and they\ncame in, and when they saw what had happened, and what it was that lay\nover me on the bed, they screamed out. The wind rushed in through the\nbroken window, and the door slammed to. They lifted off the body of my\ndear mother, and laid her, covered up with a sheet, on the bed after I\nhad got up. They were all so frightened and nervous that I directed them\nto go to the dining-room and have each a glass of wine. The door flew\nopen for an instant and closed again. The maids shrieked, and then went\nin a body to the dining-room; and I laid what flowers I had on my dear\nmother's breast. When they were there I remembered what Dr. Van Helsing\nhad told me, but I didn't like to remove them, and, besides, I would\nhave some of the servants to sit up with me now. I was surprised that\nthe maids did not come back. I called them, but got no answer, so I went\nto the dining-room to look for them.\n\nMy heart sank when I saw what had happened. They all four lay helpless\non the floor, breathing heavily. The decanter of sherry was on the table\nhalf full, but there was a queer, acrid smell about. I was suspicious,\nand examined the decanter. It smelt of laudanum, and looking on the\nsideboard, I found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses for\nher--oh! did use--was empty. What am I to do? what am I to do? I am back\nin the room with mother. I cannot leave her, and I am alone, save for\nthe sleeping servants, whom some one has drugged. Alone with the dead! I\ndare not go out, for I can hear the low howl of the wolf through the\nbroken window.\n\nThe air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from\nthe window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God\nshield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast,\nwhere they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother\ngone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not\nsurvive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nDR. SEWARD'S DIARY\n\n\n_18 September._--I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early.\nKeeping my cab at the gate, I went up the avenue alone. I knocked gently\nand rang as quietly as possible, for I feared to disturb Lucy or her\nmother, and hoped to only bring a servant to the door. After a while,\nfinding no response, I knocked and rang again; still no answer. I cursed\nthe laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an\nhour--for it was now ten o'clock--and so rang and knocked again, but\nmore impatiently, but still without response. Hitherto I had blamed only\nthe servants, but now a terrible fear began to assail me. Was this\ndesolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing\ntight around us? Was it indeed a house of death to which I had come, too\nlate? I knew that minutes, even seconds of delay, might mean hours of\ndanger to Lucy, if she had had again one of those frightful relapses;\nand I went round the house to try if I could find by chance an entry\nanywhere.\n\nI could find no means of ingress. Every window and door was fastened and\nlocked, and I returned baffled to the porch. As I did so, I heard the\nrapid pit-pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet. They stopped at the\ngate, and a few seconds later I met Van Helsing running up the avenue.\nWhen he saw me, he gasped out:--\n\n\"Then it was you, and just arrived. How is she? Are we too late? Did you\nnot get my telegram?\"\n\nI answered as quickly and coherently as I could that I had only got his\ntelegram early in the morning, and had not lost a minute in coming here,\nand that I could not make any one in the house hear me. He paused and\nraised his hat as he said solemnly:--\n\n\"Then I fear we are too late. God's will be done!\" With his usual\nrecuperative energy, he went on: \"Come. If there be no way open to get\nin, we must make one. Time is all in all to us now.\"\n\nWe went round to the back of the house, where there was a kitchen\nwindow. The Professor took a small surgical saw from his case, and\nhanding it to me, pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window. I\nattacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them. Then\nwith a long, thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and\nopened the window. I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There\nwas no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms, which were close at\nhand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room,\ndimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four\nservant-women lying on the floor. There was no need to think them dead,\nfor their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the\nroom left no doubt as to their condition. Van Helsing and I looked at\neach other, and as we moved away he said: \"We can attend to them later.\"\nThen we ascended to Lucy's room. For an instant or two we paused at the\ndoor to listen, but there was no sound that we could hear. With white\nfaces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the\nroom.\n\nHow shall I describe what we saw? On the bed lay two women, Lucy and her\nmother. The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white\nsheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the\nbroken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror\nfixed upon it. By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more\ndrawn. The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her\nmother's bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds\nwhich we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled.\nWithout a word the Professor bent over the bed, his head almost touching\npoor Lucy's breast; then he gave a quick turn of his head, as of one who\nlistens, and leaping to his feet, he cried out to me:--\n\n\"It is not yet too late! Quick! quick! Bring the brandy!\"\n\nI flew downstairs and returned with it, taking care to smell and taste\nit, lest it, too, were drugged like the decanter of sherry which I found\non the table. The maids were still breathing, but more restlessly, and I\nfancied that the narcotic was wearing off. I did not stay to make sure,\nbut returned to Van Helsing. He rubbed the brandy, as on another\noccasion, on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her\nhands. He said to me:--\n\n\"I can do this, all that can be at the present. You go wake those maids.\nFlick them in the face with a wet towel, and flick them hard. Make them\nget heat and fire and a warm bath. This poor soul is nearly as cold as\nthat beside her. She will need be heated before we can do anything\nmore.\"\n\nI went at once, and found little difficulty in waking three of the\nwomen. The fourth was only a young girl, and the drug had evidently\naffected her more strongly, so I lifted her on the sofa and let her\nsleep. The others were dazed at first, but as remembrance came back to\nthem they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner. I was stern with\nthem, however, and would not let them talk. I told them that one life\nwas bad enough to lose, and that if they delayed they would sacrifice\nMiss Lucy. So, sobbing and crying, they went about their way, half clad\nas they were, and prepared fire and water. Fortunately, the kitchen and\nboiler fires were still alive, and there was no lack of hot water. We\ngot a bath and carried Lucy out as she was and placed her in it. Whilst\nwe were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door. One\nof the maids ran off, hurried on some more clothes, and opened it. Then\nshe returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come\nwith a message from Mr. Holmwood. I bade her simply tell him that he\nmust wait, for we could see no one now. She went away with the message,\nand, engrossed with our work, I clean forgot all about him.\n\nI never saw in all my experience the Professor work in such deadly\nearnest. I knew--as he knew--that it was a stand-up fight with death,\nand in a pause told him so. He answered me in a way that I did not\nunderstand, but with the sternest look that his face could wear:--\n\n\"If that were all, I would stop here where we are now, and let her fade\naway into peace, for I see no light in life over her horizon.\" He went\non with his work with, if possible, renewed and more frenzied vigour.\n\nPresently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to\nbe of some effect. Lucy's heart beat a trifle more audibly to the\nstethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement. Van Helsing's\nface almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in\na hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--\n\n\"The first gain is ours! Check to the King!\"\n\nWe took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid\nher in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed\nthat Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was\nstill unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had\never seen her.\n\nVan Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her\nand not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me\nout of the room.\n\n\"We must consult as to what is to be done,\" he said as we descended the\nstairs. In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in, he\nclosing the door carefully behind him. The shutters had been opened, but\nthe blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette of\ndeath which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly\nobserves. The room was, therefore, dimly dark. It was, however, light\nenough for our purposes. Van Helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved\nby a look of perplexity. He was evidently torturing his mind about\nsomething, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--\n\n\"What are we to do now? Where are we to turn for help? We must have\nanother transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl's life\nwon't be worth an hour's purchase. You are exhausted already; I am\nexhausted too. I fear to trust those women, even if they would have\ncourage to submit. What are we to do for some one who will open his\nveins for her?\"\n\n\"What's the matter with me, anyhow?\"\n\nThe voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought\nrelief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris. Van\nHelsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and a\nglad look came into his eyes as I cried out: \"Quincey Morris!\" and\nrushed towards him with outstretched hands.\n\n\"What brought you here?\" I cried as our hands met.\n\n\"I guess Art is the cause.\"\n\nHe handed me a telegram:--\n\n\"Have not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.\nCannot leave. Father still in same condition. Send me word how Lucy is.\nDo not delay.--HOLMWOOD.\"\n\n\"I think I came just in the nick of time. You know you have only to tell\nme what to do.\"\n\nVan Helsing strode forward, and took his hand, looking him straight in\nthe eyes as he said:--\n\n\"A brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in\ntrouble. You're a man and no mistake. Well, the devil may work against\nus for all he's worth, but God sends us men when we want them.\"\n\nOnce again we went through that ghastly operation. I have not the heart\nto go through with the details. Lucy had got a terrible shock and it\ntold on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her\nveins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other\noccasions. Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see\nand hear. However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van\nHelsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with\ngood effect. Her faint became a profound slumber. The Professor watched\nwhilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids\nto pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting. I left Quincey lying down\nafter having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good\nbreakfast. Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where\nLucy now was. When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet or\ntwo of note-paper in his hand. He had evidently read it, and was\nthinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow. There was a look\nof grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.\nHe handed me the paper saying only: \"It dropped from Lucy's breast when\nwe carried her to the bath.\"\n\nWhen I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause\nasked him: \"In God's name, what does it all mean? Was she, or is she,\nmad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?\" I was so bewildered that I\ndid not know what to say more. Van Helsing put out his hand and took the\npaper, saying:--\n\n\"Do not trouble about it now. Forget it for the present. You shall know\nand understand it all in good time; but it will be later. And now what\nis it that you came to me to say?\" This brought me back to fact, and I\nwas all myself again.\n\n\"I came to speak about the certificate of death. If we do not act\nproperly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have\nto be produced. I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we\nhad it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did. I know, and you\nknow, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs. Westenra\nhad disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it. Let us\nfill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the\nregistrar and go on to the undertaker.\"\n\n\"Good, oh my friend John! Well thought of! Truly Miss Lucy, if she be\nsad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that\nlove her. One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old\nman. Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind! I love you all the\nmore for it! Now go.\"\n\nIn the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him\nthat Mrs. Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now\ngoing on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her. I told him\nwhere I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--\n\n\"When you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to\nourselves?\" I nodded in reply and went out. I found no difficulty about\nthe registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in\nthe evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.\n\nWhen I got back Quincey was waiting for me. I told him I would see him\nas soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room. She was still\nsleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her\nside. From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he\nexpected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.\nSo I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where\nthe blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful, or\nrather less cheerless, than the other rooms. When we were alone, he said\nto me:--\n\n\"Jack Seward, I don't want to shove myself in anywhere where I've no\nright to be; but this is no ordinary case. You know I loved that girl\nand wanted to marry her; but, although that's all past and gone, I can't\nhelp feeling anxious about her all the same. What is it that's wrong\nwith her? The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see\nthat--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have\n_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.\nNow I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man\nmust not expect to know what they consult about in private. But this is\nno common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part. Is not that\nso?\"\n\n\"That's so,\" I said, and he went on:--\n\n\"I take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did\nto-day. Is not that so?\"\n\n\"That's so.\"\n\n\"And I guess Art was in it too. When I saw him four days ago down at his\nown place he looked queer. I have not seen anything pulled down so quick\nsince I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass\nall in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at\nher in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there\nwasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a\nbullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without\nbetraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?\" As he spoke\nthe poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in a torture of suspense\nregarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the terrible\nmystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain. His very\nheart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there was a\nroyal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down. I paused before\nanswering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the\nProfessor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed\nso much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered\nin the same phrase: \"That's so.\"\n\n\"And how long has this been going on?\"\n\n\"About ten days.\"\n\n\"Ten days! Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature\nthat we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood\nof four strong men. Man alive, her whole body wouldn't hold it.\" Then,\ncoming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: \"What took it\nout?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"That,\" I said, \"is the crux. Van Helsing is simply\nfrantic about it, and I am at my wits' end. I can't even hazard a guess.\nThere has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out\nall our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall\nnot occur again. Here we stay until all be well--or ill.\" Quincey held\nout his hand. \"Count me in,\" he said. \"You and the Dutchman will tell me\nwhat to do, and I'll do it.\"\n\nWhen she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy's first movement was to feel\nin her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing\nhad given me to read. The careful Professor had replaced it where it had\ncome from, lest on waking she should be alarmed. Her eye then lit on Van\nHelsing and on me too, and gladdened. Then she looked around the room,\nand seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put her\npoor thin hands before her pale face. We both understood what that\nmeant--that she had realised to the full her mother's death; so we tried\nwhat we could to comfort her. Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but\nshe was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for\na long time. We told her that either or both of us would now remain with\nher all the time, and that seemed to comfort her. Towards dusk she fell\ninto a doze. Here a very odd thing occurred. Whilst still asleep she\ntook the paper from her breast and tore it in two. Van Helsing stepped\nover and took the pieces from her. All the same, however, she went on\nwith the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her\nhands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering\nthe fragments. Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as\nif in thought, but he said nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid\nto sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it. The Professor and\nI took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment\nunattended. Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew\nthat all night long he patrolled round and round the house.\n\nWhen the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor Lucy's\nstrength. She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little\nnourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good. At times she\nslept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between\nsleeping and waking. Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more\nhaggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale\ngums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and\nsharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently\nchanged the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying\none. In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.\nQuincey went off to meet him at the station.\n\nWhen he arrived it was nearly six o'clock, and the sun was setting full\nand warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more\ncolour to the pale cheeks. When he saw her, Arthur was simply choking\nwith emotion, and none of us could speak. In the hours that had passed,\nthe fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for it, had\ngrown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was possible\nwere shortened. Arthur's presence, however, seemed to act as a\nstimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she\nhad done since we arrived. He too pulled himself together, and spoke as\ncheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.\n\nIt was now nearly one o'clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with\nher. I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering\nthis on Lucy's phonograph. Until six o'clock they are to try to rest. I\nfear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too\ngreat; the poor child cannot rally. God help us all.\n\n\n_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra._\n\n(Unopened by her.)\n\n\"_17 September._\n\n\"My dearest Lucy,--\n\n\"It seems _an age_ since I heard from you, or indeed since I wrote. You\nwill pardon me, I know, for all my faults when you have read all my\nbudget of news. Well, I got my husband back all right; when we arrived\nat Exeter there was a carriage waiting for us, and in it, though he had\nan attack of gout, Mr. Hawkins. He took us to his house, where there\nwere rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together. After\ndinner Mr. Hawkins said:--\n\n\"'My dears, I want to drink your health and prosperity; and may every\nblessing attend you both. I know you both from children, and have, with\nlove and pride, seen you grow up. Now I want you to make your home here\nwith me. I have left to me neither chick nor child; all are gone, and in\nmy will I have left you everything.' I cried, Lucy dear, as Jonathan and\nthe old man clasped hands. Our evening was a very, very happy one.\n\n\"So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my\nbedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral\nclose, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow\nstone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and\ncawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of\nrooks--and humans. I am busy, I need not tell you, arranging things and\nhousekeeping. Jonathan and Mr. Hawkins are busy all day; for, now that\nJonathan is a partner, Mr. Hawkins wants to tell him all about the\nclients.\n\n\"How is your dear mother getting on? I wish I could run up to town for a\nday or two to see you, dear, but I dare not go yet, with so much on my\nshoulders; and Jonathan wants looking after still. He is beginning to\nput some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by the\nlong illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden\nway and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his usual\nplacidity. However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent as the\ndays go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust. And now\nI have told you my news, let me ask yours. When are you to be married,\nand where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are you to wear,\nand is it to be a public or a private wedding? Tell me all about it,\ndear; tell me all about everything, for there is nothing which interests\nyou which will not be dear to me. Jonathan asks me to send his\n'respectful duty,' but I do not think that is good enough from the\njunior partner of the important firm Hawkins & Harker; and so, as you\nlove me, and he loves me, and I love you with all the moods and tenses\nof the verb, I send you simply his 'love' instead. Good-bye, my dearest\nLucy, and all blessings on you.\n\n\"Yours,\n\n\"MINA HARKER.\"\n\n\n_Report from Patrick Hennessey, M. D., M. R. C. S. L. K. Q. C. P. I.,\netc., etc., to John Seward, M. D._\n\n\"_20 September._\n\n\"My dear Sir,--\n\n\"In accordance with your wishes, I enclose report of the conditions of\neverything left in my charge.... With regard to patient, Renfield, there\nis more to say. He has had another outbreak, which might have had a\ndreadful ending, but which, as it fortunately happened, was unattended\nwith any unhappy results. This afternoon a carrier's cart with two men\nmade a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours--the house to\nwhich, you will remember, the patient twice ran away. The men stopped at\nour gate to ask the porter their way, as they were strangers. I was\nmyself looking out of the study window, having a smoke after dinner, and\nsaw one of them come up to the house. As he passed the window of\nRenfield's room, the patient began to rate him from within, and called\nhim all the foul names he could lay his tongue to. The man, who seemed a\ndecent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to \"shut up for a\nfoul-mouthed beggar,\" whereon our man accused him of robbing him and\nwanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to\nswing for it. I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,\nso he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his\nmind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying: 'Lor' bless\nyer, sir, I wouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse. I\npity ye and the guv'nor for havin' to live in the house with a wild\nbeast like that.' Then he asked his way civilly enough, and I told him\nwhere the gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats\nand curses and revilings from our man. I went down to see if I could\nmake out any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a\nwell-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had\never occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most\ngenial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he\nblandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe\nthat he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to\nsay, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an\nhour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the\nwindow of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the\nattendants to follow me, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent\non some mischief. My fear was justified when I saw the same cart which\nhad passed before coming down the road, having on it some great wooden\nboxes. The men were wiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the\nface, as if with violent exercise. Before I could get up to him the\npatient rushed at them, and pulling one of them off the cart, began to\nknock his head against the ground. If I had not seized him just at the\nmoment I believe he would have killed the man there and then. The other\nfellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his\nheavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but\nseized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and\nfro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others\nwere both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we\nbegan to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat\non him, he began to shout: 'I'll frustrate them! They shan't rob me!\nthey shan't murder me by inches! I'll fight for my Lord and Master!' and\nall sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable\ndifficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded\nroom. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set\nit all right; and he is going on well.\n\n\"The two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for\ndamages, and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us. Their\nthreats were, however, mingled with some sort of indirect apology for\nthe defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman. They said that if it\nhad not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and\nraising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of\nhim. They gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary\nstate of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of\ntheir occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their\nlabours of any place of public entertainment. I quite understood their\ndrift, and after a stiff glass of grog, or rather more of the same, and\nwith each a sovereign in hand, they made light of the attack, and swore\nthat they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of\nmeeting so 'bloomin' good a bloke' as your correspondent. I took their\nnames and addresses, in case they might be needed. They are as\nfollows:--Jack Smollet, of Dudding's Rents, King George's Road, Great\nWalworth, and Thomas Snelling, Peter Farley's Row, Guide Court, Bethnal\nGreen. They are both in the employment of Harris & Sons, Moving and\nShipment Company, Orange Master's Yard, Soho.\n\n\"I shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here, and shall\nwire you at once if there is anything of importance.\n\n\"Believe me, dear Sir,\n\n\"Yours faithfully,\n\n\"PATRICK HENNESSEY.\"\n\n\n_Letter, Mina Harker to Lucy Westenra_.\n\n(Unopened by her.)\n\n\"_18 September._\n\n\"My dearest Lucy,--\n\n\"Such a sad blow has befallen us. Mr. Hawkins has died very suddenly.\nSome may not think it so sad for us, but we had both come to so love him\nthat it really seems as though we had lost a father. I never knew either\nfather or mother, so that the dear old man's death is a real blow to me.\nJonathan is greatly distressed. It is not only that he feels sorrow,\ndeep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all his life,\nand now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a\nfortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the\ndream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account. He says the\namount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous. He\nbegins to doubt himself. I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in _him_\nhelps him to have a belief in himself. But it is here that the grave\nshock that he experienced tells upon him the most. Oh, it is too hard\nthat a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature which\nenabled him by our dear, good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master\nin a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of its\nstrength is gone.
