{"genre": ["Horror"], "text": ["\nnvitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?\n\nOne moment. I thank you, sir; and the clerk laid the two sheets of\npaper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. Thank you,\nsir, he said at last, returning both; it\u2122s a very interesting\nautograph.\n\nThere was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.\nWhy did you compare them, Guest? he inquired suddenly.\n\nWell, sir, returned the clerk, there\u2122s a rather singular\nresemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only\ndifferently sloped.\n\nRather quaint, said Utterson.\n\nIt is, as you say, rather quaint, returned Guest.\n\nI wouldn\u2122t speak of this note, you know, said the master.\n\nNo, sir, said the clerk. I understand.\n\nBut no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the\nnote into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. What! he\nthought. Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer! And his blood ran cold in\nhis veins.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT OF DR. LANYON\n\nTime ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death\nof Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had\ndisappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never\nexisted. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable:\ntales came out of the man\u2122s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of\nhis vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to\nhave surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a\nwhisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of\nthe murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,\nMr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to\ngrow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his\nway of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.\nNow that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for\nDr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his\nfriends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and\nwhilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less\ndistinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air,\nhe did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward\nconsciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was\nat peace.\n\nOn the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor\u2122s with a small\nparty; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from\none to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable\nfriends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against\nthe lawyer. The doctor was confined to the house, Poole said, and\nsaw no one. On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and\nhaving now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost\ndaily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The\nfifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook\nhimself to Dr. Lanyon\u2122s.\n\nThere at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he\nwas shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor\u2122s\nappearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The\nrosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly\nbalder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift\nphysical decay that arrested the lawyer\u2122s notice, as a look in the eye\nand quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror\nof the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet\nthat was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. Yes, he thought; he\nis a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;\nand the knowledge is more than he can bear. And yet when Utterson\nremarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that\nLanyon declared himself a doomed man.\n\nI have had a shock, he said, and I shall never recover. It is a\nquestion of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,\nI used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more\nglad to get away.\n\nJekyll is ill, too, observed Utterson. Have you seen him?\n\nBut Lanyon\u2122s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. I wish to\nsee or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll, he said in a loud, unsteady voice.\nI am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any\nallusion to one whom I regard as dead.\n\nTut, tut! said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,\nCan\u2122t I do anything? he inquired. We are three very old friends,\nLanyon; we shall not live to make others.\n\nNothing can be done, returned Lanyon; ask himself.\n\nHe will not see me, said the lawyer.\n\nI am not surprised at that, was the reply. Some day, Utterson, after\nI am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I\ncannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me\nof other things, for God\u2122s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep\nclear of this accursed topic, then in God\u2122s name, go, for I cannot bear\nit.\n\nAs soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,\ncomplaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of\nthis unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long\nanswer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious\nin drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. I do not blame our\nold friend, Jekyll wrote, but I share his view that we must never\nmeet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you\nmust not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is\noften shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I\nhave brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If\nI am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could\nnot think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors\nso unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this\ndestiny, and that is to respect my silence. Utterson was amazed; the\ndark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to\nhis old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with\nevery promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,\nfriendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were\nwrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in\nview of Lanyon\u2122s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper\nground.\n\nA week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less\nthan a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he\nhad been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,\nand sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set\nbefore him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal\nof his dead friend. PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE,\nand in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_, so it was\nemphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the\ncontents. I have buried one friend to-day, he thought: what if this\nshould cost me another? And then he condemned the fear as a\ndisloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure,\nlikewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as not to be opened till\nthe death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll. Utterson could not\ntrust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad\nwill which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the\nidea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in\nthe will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man\nHyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.\nWritten by the hand of Lanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity\ncame on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to\nthe bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his\ndead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the\ninmost corner of his private safe.\n\nIt is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may\nbe doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his\nsurviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but\nhis thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but\nhe was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart,\nhe preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by\nthe air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into\nthat house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its\ninscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to\ncommunicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined\nhimself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes\neven sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not\nread; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so\nused to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off\nlittle by little in the frequency of his visits.\n\n\n\nINCIDENT AT THE WINDOW\n\nIt chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.\nEnfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that\nwhen they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.\n\nWell, said Enfield, that story\u2122s at an end at least. We shall never\nsee more of Mr. Hyde.\n\nI hope not, said Utterson. Did I ever tell you that I once saw him,\nand shared your feeling of repulsion?\n\nIt was impossible to do the one without the other, returned Enfield.\nAnd by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that\nthis was a back way to Dr. Jekyll\u2122s! It was partly your own fault that\nI found it out, even when I did.\n\nSo you found it out, did you? said Utterson. But if that be so, we\nmay step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the\ntruth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if\nthe presence of a friend might do him good.\n\nThe court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature\ntwilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with\nsunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and\nsitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of\nmien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.\n\nWhat! Jekyll! he cried. I trust you are better.\n\nI am very low, Utterson, replied the doctor drearily, very low. It\nwill not last long, thank God.\n\nYou stay too much indoors, said the lawyer. You should be out,\nwhipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my\ncousin\u201dMr. Enfield\u201dDr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick\nturn with us.\n\nYou are very good, sighed the other. I should like to very much; but\nno, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I\nam very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask\nyou and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.\n\nWhy, then, said the lawyer, good-naturedly, the best thing we can do\nis to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.\n\nThat is just what I was about to venture to propose, returned the\ndoctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the\nsmile was struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such\nabject terror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen\nbelow. They saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly\nthrust down; but that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and\nleft the court without a word. In silence, too, they traversed the\nby-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring\nthoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings\nof life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.\nThey were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes.\n\nGod forgive us, God forgive us, said Mr. Utterson.\n\nBut Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once\nmore in silence.\n\n\n\nTHE LAST NIGHT\n\nMr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when\nhe was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.\n\nBless me, Poole, what brings you here? he cried; and then taking a\nsecond look at him, What ails you? he added; is the doctor ill?\n\nMr. Utterson, said the man, there is something wrong.\n\nTake a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you, said the lawyer.\nNow, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.\n\nYou know the doctor\u2122s ways, sir, replied Poole, and how he shuts\nhimself up. Well, he\u2122s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don\u2122t like\nit, sir\u201dI wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I\u2122m afraid.\n\nNow, my good man, said the lawyer, be explicit. What are you afraid\nof?\n\nI\u2122ve been afraid for about a week, returned Poole, doggedly\ndisregarding the question, and I can bear it no more.\n\nThe man\u2122s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered\nfor the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced\nhis terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he\nsat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed\nto a corner of the floor. I can bear it no more, he repeated.\n\nCome, said the lawyer, I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see\nthere is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.\n\nI think there\u2122s been foul play, said Poole, hoarsely.\n\nFoul play! cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather\ninclined to be irritated in consequence. What foul play! What does the\nman mean?\n\nI daren\u2122t say, sir, was the answer; but will you come along with me\nand see for yourself?\n\nMr. Utterson\u2122s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;\nbut he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared\nupon the butler\u2122s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was\nstill untasted when he set it down to follow.\n\nIt was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying\non her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the\nmost diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and\nflecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets\nunusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had\nnever seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it\notherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish\nto see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there\nwas borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The\nsquare, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin\ntrees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole,\nwho had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the\nmiddle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off\nhis hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all\nthe hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he\nwiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face\nwas white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.\n\nWell, sir, he said, here we are, and God grant there be nothing\nwrong.\n\nAmen, Poole, said the lawyer.\n\nThereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was\nopened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, Is that you,\nPoole?\n\nIt\u2122s all right, said Poole. Open the door.\n\nThe hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was\nbuilt high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and\nwomen, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of\nMr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the\ncook, crying out Bless God! it\u2122s Mr. Utterson, ran forward as if to\ntake him in her arms.\n\nWhat, what? Are you all here? said the lawyer peevishly. Very\nirregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.\n\nThey\u2122re all afraid, said Poole.\n\nBlank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her\nvoice and now wept loudly.\n\nHold your tongue! Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that\ntestified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so\nsuddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and\nturned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. And\nnow, continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, reach me a\ncandle, and we\u2122ll get this through hands at once. And then he begged\nMr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.\n\nNow, sir, said he, you come as gently as you can. I want you to\nhear, and I don\u2122t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any\nchance he was to ask you in, don\u2122t go.\n\nMr. Utterson\u2122s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk\nthat nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage\nand followed the butler into the laboratory building through the\nsurgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of\nthe stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen;\nwhile he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and\nobvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a\nsomewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.\n\nMr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you, he called; and even as he did\nso, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.\n\nA voice answered from within: Tell him I cannot see anyone, it said\ncomplainingly.\n\nThank you, sir, said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in\nhis voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across\nthe yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the\nbeetles were leaping on the floor.\n\nSir, he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, Was that my master\u2122s\nvoice?\n\nIt seems much changed, replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look\nfor look.\n\nChanged? Well, yes, I think so, said the butler. Have I been twenty\nyears in this man\u2122s house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir;\nmaster\u2122s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we\nheard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who\u2122s_ in there instead of\nhim, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.\nUtterson!\n\nThis is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my\nman, said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. Suppose it were as you\nsuppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been\u201dwell, murdered what could\ninduce the murderer to stay? That won\u2122t hold water; it doesn\u2122t commend\nitself to reason.\n\nWell, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I\u2122ll do it\nyet, said Poole. All this last week (you must know) him, or it,\nwhatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and\nday for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was\nsometimes his way\u201dthe master\u2122s, that is\u201dto write his orders on a sheet\nof paper and throw it on the stair. We\u2122ve had nothing else this week\nback; nothing but papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left\nthere to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day,\nay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and\ncomplaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists\nin town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another\npaper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another\norder to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir,\nwhatever for.\n\nHave you any of these papers? asked Mr. Utterson.\n\nPoole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the\nlawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents\nran thus: Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He\nassures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his\npresent purpose. In the year 18\u201d, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large\nquantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous\ncare, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at\nonce. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can\nhardly be exaggerated. So far the letter had run composedly enough,\nbut here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer\u2122s emotion had\nbroken loose. For God\u2122s sake, he added, find me some of the old.\n\nThis is a strange note, said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, How do\nyou come to have it open?\n\nThe man at Maw\u2122s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like\nso much dirt, returned Poole.\n\nThis is unquestionably the doctor\u2122s hand, do you know? resumed the\nlawyer.\n\nI thought it looked like it, said the servant rather sulkily; and\nthen, with another voice, But what matters hand of write? he said.\nI\u2122ve seen him!\n\nSeen him? repeated Mr. Utterson. Well?\n\nThat\u2122s it! said Poole. It was this way. I came suddenly into the\ntheatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this\ndrug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was\nat the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when\nI came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet.\nIt was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my\nhead like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon\nhis face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run\nfrom me? I have served him long enough. And then... The man paused and\npassed his hand over his face.\n\nThese are all very strange circumstances, said Mr. Utterson, but I\nthink I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized\nwith one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer;\nhence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask\nand the avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this\ndrug, by means of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate\nrecovery\u201dGod grant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it\nis sad enough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain\nand natural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant\nalarms.\n\nSir, said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, that\nthing was not my master, and there\u2122s the truth. My master\u201dhere he\nlooked round him and began to whisper\u201dis a tall, fine build of a man,\nand this was more of a dwarf. Utterson attempted to protest. O, sir,\ncried Poole, do you think I do not know my master after twenty years?\nDo you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door,\nwhere I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the\nmask was never Dr. Jekyll\u201dGod knows what it was, but it was never Dr.\nJekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.\n\nPoole, replied the lawyer, if you say that, it will become my duty\nto make certain. Much as I desire to spare your master\u2122s feelings, much\nas I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still\nalive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.\n\nAh, Mr. Utterson, that\u2122s talking! cried the butler.\n\nAnd now comes the second question, resumed Utterson: Who is going to\ndo it?\n\nWhy, you and me, sir, was the undaunted reply.\n\nThat\u2122s very well said, returned the lawyer; and whatever comes of\nit, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.\n\nThere is an axe in the theatre, continued Poole; and you might take\nthe kitchen poker for yourself.\n\nThe lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and\nbalanced it. Do you know, Poole, he said, looking up, that you and I\nare about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?\n\nYou may say so, sir, indeed, returned the butler.\n\nIt is well, then that we should be frank, said the other. We both\nthink more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked\nfigure that you saw, did you recognise it?\n\nWell, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that\nI could hardly swear to that, was the answer. But if you mean, was it\nMr. Hyde?\u201dwhy, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same\nbigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who\nelse could have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot,\nsir, that at the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But\nthat\u2122s not all. I don\u2122t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr.\nHyde?\n\nYes, said the lawyer, I once spoke with him.\n\nThen you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something\nqueer about that gentleman\u201dsomething that gave a man a turn\u201dI don\u2122t\nknow rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your\nmarrow kind of cold and thin.\n\nI own I felt something of what you describe, said Mr. Utterson.\n\nQuite so, sir, returned Poole. Well, when that masked thing like a\nmonkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it\nwent down my spine like ice. O, I know it\u2122s not evidence, Mr. Utterson;\nI\u2122m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I\ngive you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!\n\nAy, ay, said the lawyer. My fears incline to the same point. Evil, I\nfear, founded\u201devil was sure to come\u201dof that connection. Ay truly, I\nbelieve you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer\n(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim\u2122s\nroom. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.\n\nThe footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.\n\nPull yourself together, Bradshaw, said the lawyer. This suspense, I\nknow, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make\nan end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the\ncabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear the\nblame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any\nmalefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round\nthe corner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the\nlaboratory door. We give you ten minutes to get to your stations.\n\nAs Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. And now, Poole, let\nus get to ours, he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the\nway into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now\nquite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that\ndeep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about\ntheir steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where\nthey sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but\nnearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a\nfootfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor.\n\nSo it will walk all day, sir, whispered Poole; ay, and the better\npart of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist,\nthere\u2122s a bit of a break. Ah, it\u2122s an ill conscience that\u2122s such an\nenemy to rest! Ah, sir, there\u2122s blood foully shed in every step of it!\nBut hark again, a little closer\u201dput your heart in your ears, Mr.\nUtterson, and tell me, is that the doctor\u2122s foot?\n\nThe steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they\nwent so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread\nof Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. Is there never anything else? he\nasked.\n\nPoole nodded. Once, he said. Once I heard it weeping!\n\nWeeping? how that? said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of\nhorror.\n\nWeeping like a woman or a lost soul, said the butler. I came away\nwith that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.\n\nBut now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from\nunder a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest\ntable to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath\nto where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in\nthe quiet of the night.\n\nJekyll, cried Utterson, with a loud voice, I demand to see you. He\npaused a moment, but there came no reply. I give you fair warning, our\nsuspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you, he resumed; if\nnot by fair means, then by foul\u201dif not of your consent, then by brute\nforce!\n\nUtterson, said the voice, for God\u2122s sake, have mercy!\n\nAh, that\u2122s not Jekyll\u2122s voice\u201dit\u2122s Hyde\u2122s! cried Utterson. Down with\nthe door, Poole!\n\nPoole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and\nthe red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal\nscreech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the\naxe again, and again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four\ntimes the blow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of\nexcellent workmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock\nburst and the wreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.\n\nThe besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had\nsucceeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet\nbefore their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and\nchattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer\nor two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer\nthe fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would\nhave said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most\ncommonplace that night in London.\n\nRight in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and\nstill twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and\nbeheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large\nfor him, clothes of the doctor\u2122s bigness; the cords of his face still\nmoved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the\ncrushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung\nupon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a\nself-destroyer.\n\nWe have come too late, he said sternly, whether to save or punish.\nHyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the\nbody of your master.\n\nThe far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre,\nwhich filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above,\nand by the cabinet, which formed an upper storey at one end and looked\nupon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the\nby-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a\nsecond flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a\nspacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet\nneeded but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell\nfrom their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was\nfilled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon\nwho was Jekyll\u2122s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they\nwere advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a\nperfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.\nNowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.\n\nPoole stamped on the flags of the corridor. He must be buried here,\nhe said, hearkening to the sound.\n\nOr he may have fled, said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door\nin the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they\nfound the key, already stained with rust.\n\nThis does not look like use, observed the lawyer.\n\nUse! echoed Poole. Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a\nman had stamped on it.\n\nAy, continued Utterson, and the fractures, too, are rusty. The two\nmen looked at each other with a scare. This is beyond me, Poole, said\nthe lawyer. Let us go back to the cabinet.\n\nThey mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional\nawestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine\nthe contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of\nchemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on\nglass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had\nbeen prevented.\n\nThat is the same drug that I was always bringing him, said Poole; and\neven as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.\n\nThis brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn\ncosily up, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter\u2122s elbow, the\nvery sugar in the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay\nbeside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy\nof a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great\nesteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.\n\nNext, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came\nto the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary\nhorror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow\nplaying on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along\nthe glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful\ncountenances stooping to look in.\n\nThis glass has seen some strange things, sir, whispered Poole.\n\nAnd surely none stranger than itself, echoed the lawyer in the same\ntones. For what did Jekyll\u201dhe caught himself up at the word with a\nstart, and then conquering the weakness\u201dwhat could Jekyll want with\nit? he said.\n\nYou may say that! said Poole.\n\nNext they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat\narray of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the\ndoctor\u2122s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and\nseveral enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in\nthe same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months\nbefore, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift\nin case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the\nlawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John\nUtterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of\nall at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.\n\nMy head goes round, he said. He has been all these days in\npossession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see\nhimself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.\n\nHe caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor\u2122s hand\nand dated at the top. O Poole! the lawyer cried, he was alive and\nhere this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he\nmust be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?\nand in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be\ncareful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire\ncatastrophe.\n\nWhy don\u2122t you read it, sir? asked Poole.\n\nBecause I fear, replied the lawyer solemnly. God grant I have no\ncause for it! And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read\nas follows:\n\n\nMy dear Utterson,\u201dWhen this shall fall into your hands, I shall have\ndisappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to\nforesee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless\nsituation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and\nfirst read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your\nhands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of\n\nYour unworthy and unhappy friend,\n\nHENRY JEKYLL.\n\n\nThere was a third enclosure? asked Utterson.\n\nHere, sir, said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet\nsealed in several places.\n\nThe lawyer put it in his pocket. I would say nothing of this paper. If\nyour master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is\nnow ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall\nbe back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.\n\nThey went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and\nUtterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the\nhall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which\nthis mystery was now to be explained.\n\n\n\nDR. LANYON\u2122S NARRATIVE\n\nOn the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening\ndelivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague\nand old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by\nthis; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had\nseen the man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could\nimagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of\nregistration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the\nletter ran:\n\n10_th December_, 18\u201d.\n\n\nDear Lanyon,\u201dYou are one of my oldest friends; and although we may\nhave differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at\nleast on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day\nwhen, if you had said to me, \u02dcJekyll, my life, my honour, my reason,\ndepend upon you,\u2122 I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.\nLanyon my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you\nfail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface,\nthat I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge\nfor yourself.\n\nI want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night\u201day, even if\nyou were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless\nyour carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in\nyour hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my\nbutler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a\nlocksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to\ngo in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand,\nbreaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, _with all its\ncontents as they stand_, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is\nthe same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of\nmind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in\nerror, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a\nphial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you\nto Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.\n\nThat is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should\nbe back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before\nmidnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the\nfear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor\nforeseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be\npreferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to\nask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own\nhand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to\nplace in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from\nmy cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude\ncompletely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation,\nyou will have understood that these arrangements are of capital\nimportance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they\nmust appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or\nthe shipwreck of my reason.\n\nConfident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart\nsinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.\nThink of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a\nblackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware\nthat, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away\nlike a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save\n\nYour friend,\n\n\nH.J.\n\n\nP.S.\u201dI had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my\nsoul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter\nnot come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear\nLanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the\ncourse of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It\nmay then already be too late; and if that night passes without event,\nyou will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.\n\n\nUpon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;\nbut till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound\nto do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less\nI was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded\ncould not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose\naccordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to\nJekyll\u2122s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by\nthe same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent\nat once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we\nwere yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman\u2122s surgical\ntheatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll\u2122s private\ncabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the\nlock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and\nhave to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was\nnear despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour\u2122s\nwork, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took\nout the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and\nreturned with it to Cavendish Square.\n\nHere I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly\nenough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so\nthat it was plain they were of Jekyll\u2122s private manufacture; and when I\nopened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple\ncrystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned\nmy attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor,\nwhich was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to\ncontain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I\ncould make no guess. The book was an ordinary version book and\ncontained little but a series of dates. These covered a period of many\nyears, but I observed that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and\nquite abruptly. Here and there a brief remark was appended to a date,\nusually no more than a single word: double occurring perhaps six\ntimes in a total of several hundred entries; and once very early in the\nlist and followed by several marks of exclamation, total failure!!!\nAll this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was\ndefinite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of\nexperiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll\u2122s investigations) to\nno end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these\narticles in my house affect either the honour, the sanity, or the life\nof my flighty colleague? If his messenger could go to one place, why\ncould he not go to another? And even granting some impediment, why was\nthis gentleman to be received by me in secret? The more I reflected the\nmore convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral\ndisease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old\nrevolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence.\n\nTwelve o\u2122clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded\nvery gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a\nsmall man crouching against the pillars of the portico.\n\nAre you come from Dr. Jekyll? I asked.\n\nHe told me yes by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him\nenter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the\ndarkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing\nwith his bull\u2122s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor\nstarted and made greater haste.\n\nThese particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed\nhim into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready\non my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I\nhad never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as\nI have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his\nface, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and\ngreat apparent debility of constitution, and\u201dlast but not least\u201dwith\nthe odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore\nsome resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked\nsinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,\npersonal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the\nsymptoms; but I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much\ndeeper in the nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the\nprinciple of hatred.\n\nThis person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance,\nstruck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was\ndressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable;\nhis clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober\nfabric, were enormously too large for him in every measurement\u201dthe\ntrousers hanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the\nground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar\nsprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous\naccoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was\nsomething abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature\nthat now faced me\u201dsomething seizing, surprising and revolting\u201dthis\nfresh disparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that\nto my interest in the man\u2122s nature and character, there was added a\ncuriosity as to his origin, his life, his fortune and status in the\nworld.\n\nThese observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set\ndown in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on\nfire with sombre excitement.\n\nHave you got it? he cried. Have you got it? And so lively was his\nimpatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake\nme.\n\nI put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my\nblood. Come, sir, said I. You forget that I have not yet the\npleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please. And I showed\nhim an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as\nfair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness\nof the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of\nmy visitor, would suffer me to muster.\n\nI beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon, he replied civilly enough. What you\nsay is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my\npoliteness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry\nJekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood... He\npaused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his\ncollected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the\nhysteria\u201dI understood, a drawer...\n\nBut here I took pity on my visitor\u2122s suspense, and some perhaps on my\nown growing curiosity.\n\nThere it is, sir, said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the\nfloor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.\n\nHe sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart; I\ncould hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and\nhis face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life\nand reason.\n\nCompose yourself, said I.\n\nHe turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of\ndespair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered\none loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next\nmoment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, Have\nyou a graduated glass? he asked.\n\nI rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he\nasked.\n\nHe thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red\ntincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first\nof a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to\nbrighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes\nof vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and\nthe compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to\na watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a\nkeen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned\nand looked upon me with an air of scrutiny.\n\nAnd now, said he, to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you\nbe guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to go\nforth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of\ncuriosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it\nshall be done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you\nwere before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service\nrendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches\nof the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of\nknowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you,\nhere, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted\nby a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.\n\nSir, said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly\npossessing, you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I\nhear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too\nfar in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.\n\nIt is well, replied my visitor. Lanyon, you remember your vows: what\nfollows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so\nlong been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have\ndenied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your\nsuperiors\u201dbehold!\n\nHe put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he\nreeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with\ninjected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I\nthought, a change\u201dhe seemed to swell\u201dhis face became suddenly black and\nthe features seemed to melt and alter\u201dand the next moment, I had sprung\nto my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield\nme from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.\n\nO God! I screamed, and O God! again and again; for there before my\neyes\u201dpale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with\nhis hands, like a man restored from death\u201dthere stood Henry Jekyll!\n\nWhat he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on\npaper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at\nit; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if\nI believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots;\nsleep has left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the\nday and night; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must\ndie; and yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that\nman unveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I cannot, even in"], "title": ["Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"], "author": ["Robert Louis Stevenson"]}
