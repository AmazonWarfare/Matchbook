If you\u2019re looking for something really simple, you should try the Pahn Kahl faith.\u201d\n\nLightsong frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t they just worship the Returned, like the rest of us?\u201d \u201cNo. They have their own religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut everyone knows the Pahn Kahl are practically Hallandren.\u201d Blushweaver shrugged, watching the stadium floor below.\n\n\u201cAnd how exactly did we get onto this tangent, anyway?\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cI swear, my dear. Sometimes our conversations remind me of a broken sword.\u201d\n\nShe raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cSharp as hell,\u201d Lightsong said, \u201cbut lacking a point.\u201d\n\nBlushweaver snorted quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who asked to meet with me, Lightsong.\u201d \u201cYes, but we both know that you wanted me to. What are you planning, Blushweaver?\u201d Blushweaver rolled her grape between her fingers. \u201cWait,\u201d she said.\n\nLightsong sighed, waving for a servant to bring him some nuts. One placed a bowl on the table; then another came forward and began to crack them for him. \u201cFirst you imply that I should join with you, now you won\u2019t tell me what you want me to do? I swear, woman. Someday, your ridiculous sense of drama is going to cause cataclysmic problems\u2014like, for instance, boredom in your companions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not drama,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s respect.\u201d She nodded directly across the arena, where the God King\u2019s box still stood empty, golden throne sitting on a pedestal above the box itself.\n\n\u201cAh. Feeling patriotic today, are we?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more that I\u2019m curious.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe queen?\u201d\n\nBlushweaver gave him a flat stare. \u201cOf course, her. Who else would I be speaking about?\u201d\n\nLightsong counted off the days. It had been a week. \u201cHuh,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cHer period of isolation is over, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really should pay more attention, Lightsong.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cTime tends to pass you by more quickly when you take no notice of it, my dear. In that, it\u2019s remarkably similar to most women I know.\u201d With that, he accepted a handful of nuts, then settled back to wait.\n\n\n\nApparently, the people of T\u2019Telir weren\u2019t fond of carriages\u2014not even to carry gods. Siri sat, somewhat bemused, as a group of servants carried her chair across the grass toward a large, circular structure at the back of the Court of Gods. It was raining. She didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d been cooped up for far too long.\n\nShe turned, twisting in her chair, looking back over a group of serving women who carried her dress\u2019s long golden train, keeping it off the wet grass. Around them all walked more women, who held a large canopy to shield Siri from the rain.\n\n\u201cCould you . . . move that aside?\u201d Siri asked. \u201cLet the rain fall on me?\u201d The serving women glanced at one another. \u201cJust for a little bit,\u201d Siri said. \u201cI promise.\u201d\nThe women shared frowns, but slowed, allowing Siri\u2019s porters to pull ahead and expose her to the rain. She looked up, smiling as the drizzle fell on her face. Seven days is far too long to spend indoors, she decided. She basked for a long moment, enjoying the cool wetness on her skin and clothing. The grass looked inviting. She glanced back again. \u201cI could walk, you know.\u201dFeel my toes on those green blades. . . .\n\nThe serving women looked very, very uncomfortable about that concept.\n\n\u201cOr not,\u201d Siri said, turning around as the women sped up, again covering the sky with their canopy. Walking was probably a bad idea, considering her dress\u2019s long train. She\u2019d eventually chosen a gown far more daring than anything she\u2019d ever worn before. The neckline was a touch low, and it had no sleeves. It also had a curious design that covered the front of her legs with a short skirt, yet was floor-length in back. She\u2019d picked it partially for the novelty, though she blushed every time she thought of how much leg it showed.\n\nThey soon arrived at the arena and her porters carried her up into it. Siri was interested to see that it had no ceiling and had a sand-covered floor. Just above the floor, a colorful group of people were gathering on ranks of benches. Though some of them carried umbrellas, many ignored the light rain, chatting amiably among themselves. Siri smiled at the crowd; a hundred different colors and as many different clothing styles were represented. It was good to see some variety again, even if that variety was somewhat garish.\n\nHer porters carried her up to a large stone cleft built into the side of the building. Here, her women slid the canopy\u2019s poles into holes in the stone, allowing it to stand freely to cover the entire box. Servants scuttled about, getting things ready, and her porters lowered her chair. She stood, frowning. She was finally free of the palace. And yet it appeared she was going to have to sit above everyone else. Even the other gods\u2014who she assumed were in the other canopied boxes\u2014were far away and separated from her by walls.\n\nHow is it that they can make me feel alone, even when surrounded by hundreds of people? She turned to one of her serving women. \u201cThe God King. Where is he?\u201d\n\nThe woman gestured toward the other boxes like Siri\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in one of them?\u201d Siri asked.\n\n\u201cNo, Vessel,\u201d the woman said, eyes downcast. \u201cHe will not arrive until the gods are all here.\u201d Ah, Siri thought. Makes sense, I guess.\n\nShe sat back in her chair as several servants prepared food. To the side, a minstrel began to play a flute, as if to drown out the sounds of the people below. She would rather have heard the people. Still, she decided not to let herself get into a bad mood. At least she was outside, and she could see other people, even if she couldn\u2019t interact with them. She smiled to herself, leaning forward, elbows on knees, as she studied the exotic colors below.\n\nWhat was she to make of T\u2019Telir people? They were just so remarkably diverse. Some had dark skin, which meant they were from the edges of the Hallandren kingdom. Others had yellow hair, or even strange hair colors\u2014blue and green\u2014that came, Siri assumed, from dyes.\nAll wore brilliant clothing, as if there were no other option. Ornate hats were popular, both on men and women. Clothing ranged from vests and shorts to long robes and gowns. How much time must they spend shopping! It was difficult enough for her to choose what to wear, and she had only about a dozen choices each day\u2014and no hats. After she\u2019d refused the first few, the servants had stopped offering them.\n\nEntourage after entourage arrived bearing a different set of colors\u2014a hue and a metallic, usually. She counted the boxes. There was room for about fifty gods, but the court had only a couple of dozen. Twenty-five, wasn\u2019t it? In each procession, she saw a figure standing taller than the others. Some\u2014 mostly the women\u2014were carried on chairs or couches. The men generally walked, some wearing intricate robes, others wearing nothing more than sandals and skirt. Siri leaned forward, studying one god as he walked right by her box. His bare chest made her blush, but it let her see his well-muscled body and toned flesh.\n\nHe glanced at her, then nodded his head slightly in respect. His servants and priests bowed almost to the ground. The god passed on, having said nothing.\n\nShe sat back in her chair, shaking her head as one of the servants offered her food. There were still four or five gods left to arrive. Apparently, the Hallandren deities weren\u2019t as punctual as Bluefingers\u2019s schedule-keeping had led her to believe.\n\n\n\nVivenna stepped through the gates, passing into the Hallandren Court of Gods, which was dominated by a group of large palaces. She hesitated, and small groups of people passed through on either side of her, though there wasn\u2019t much of a crowd.\n\nDenth had been right; it had been easy for her to get into the court. The priests at the gate had waved Vivenna through without even asking her identity. They had even let Parlin pass, assuming him to be her attendant. She turned back, glancing at the priests in their blue robes. She could see bubbles of colorfulness around them, indications of their strong BioChroma.\n\nShe\u2019d been tutored about this. The priests guarding the gates had enough Breath to get them to the First Heightening, the state at which a person gained the ability to distinguish levels of Breath in other people. Vivenna had it too. It wasn\u2019t that auras or colors looked different to her. In fact, the ability to distinguish Breath was similar to the perfect pitch she had gained. Other people heard the same sounds she did, she just had the ability to pick them apart.\n\nShe saw how close a person had to get to one of the priests before the colors increased, and she saw exactly how much more colorful those hues became. This information let her know instinctively that each of the priests was of the First Heightening. Parlin had one Breath. The ordinary citizens, who had to present papers to gain entrance to the court, also each had only one Breath. She could tell how strong that Breath was, and if the person was sick or not.\n\nThe priests each had exactly fifty Breaths, as did the majority of the wealthier individuals entering through the gates. A fair number had at least two hundred Breaths, enough for the Second Heightening and the perfect pitch it granted. Only a couple had more Breaths than Vivenna, who had reached all the way to the Third Heightening and the perfect color perception it granted.\nShe turned away from her study of the crowd. She\u2019d been tutored about the Heightenings, but she\u2019d never expected to experience one firsthand. She felt dirty. Perverse. Particularly because the colors were just so beautiful.\n\nHer tutors had explained how the court was composed of a wide circle of palaces, but they had not mentioned how each palace was so harmoniously balanced in color. Each was a work of art, utilizing subtle color gradients that normal people just wouldn\u2019t be able to appreciate. These sat on a perfect, uniformly green lawn. It was trimmed carefully, and it was marred by neither road nor walkway. Vivenna stepped onto it, Parlin at her side, and she felt an urge to kick off her shoes and walk barefoot in the dew-moistened grass. That wouldn\u2019t be appropriate at all, and she stifled the impulse.\n\nThe drizzle was finally starting to let up, and Parlin lowered the umbrella he\u2019d bought to keep them both dry. \u201cSo, this is it,\u201d he said, shaking off the umbrella. \u201cThe Court of Gods.\u201d\n\nVivenna nodded.\n\n\u201cGood place to graze sheep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d she said quietly.\n\nParlin frowned. \u201cGoats, then?\u201d he said finally.\n\nVivenna sighed, and they joined the small procession walking across the grass toward a large structure outside the circle of palaces. She\u2019d been worried about standing out\u2014after all, she still wore her simple Idrian dress, with its high neck, practical fabric, and muted colors. She was beginning to realize that there just wasn\u2019t a way to stand out in T\u2019Telir.\n\nThe people around her wore such a stunning variety of costumes that she wondered who had the imagination to design them all. Some were as modest as Vivenna\u2019s and others even had muted colors\u2014 though these were usually accented by bright scarves or hats. Modesty in both design and color was obviously unfashionable, but not nonexistent.\n\nIt\u2019s all about drawing attention, she realized. The whites and faded colors are a reaction against the bright colors. But because everyone tries so hard to look distinctive, nobody does!\n\nFeeling a little more secure, she glanced at Parlin, who seemed more at peace now that they were away from the larger crowds in the city below. \u201cInteresting buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people wear so much color, but that palace is just one color. Wonder why that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not one color. It\u2019s many different shades of the same color.\u201d Parlin shrugged. \u201cRed is red.\u201d\n\nHow could she explain? Each red was different, like notes on a musical scale. The walls were of pure red. The roof tiles, side columns, and other ornamentations were of slightly different shades, each distinct and intentional. The columns, for instance, formed stepping fifths of color, harmonizing with the base tint of the walls.\nIt was like a symphony of hues. The building had obviously been constructed for a person who had achieved the Third Heightening, as only such a person would be able to see the ideal resonance. To others . . . well, it was just a bunch of red.\n\nThey passed the red palace, approaching the arena. Entertainment was central to the lives of the Hallandren gods. After all, one couldn\u2019t expect gods to do anything useful with their time. Often they were diverted in their palaces or on the courtyard lawn, but for particularly large events, there was the arena\u2014which also served as the location of Hallandren legislative debates. Today, the priests would argue for the sport of their deities.\n\nVivenna and Parlin waited their turn as the people crowded around the arena entrance. Vivenna glanced toward another gateway, wondering why nobody used it. The answer was made manifest as a figure approached. He was surrounded by servants, some carrying a canopy. All were dressed in blue and silver, matching their leader, who stood a good head taller than the others. He gave off a BioChromatic aura such as Vivenna had never seen\u2014though, admittedly, she\u2019d been able to see them for only a few hours. His bubble of enhanced color was enormous; it extended nearly thirty feet. To her First Heightening senses, the god\u2019s Breath registered as infinite. Immea sur able. For the first time, Vivenna could see that there was something different about the Returned. They weren\u2019t just Awakeners with more power; it was like they had only a single Breath, but that Breath was so im mensely powerful that it single-handedly propelled them to the upper Heightenings.\n\nThe god entered the arena through the open gateway. As she watched him, Vivenna\u2019s sense of awe dissipated. There was an arrogance in this man\u2019s posture, a dismissiveness to the way he entered freely while others waited their turn at an overcrowded entrance.\n\nTo keep him alive, Vivenna thought, he has to absorb a person\u2019s Breath each week.\n\nShe\u2019d let herself become too relaxed, and she felt her revulsion return. Color and beauty couldn\u2019t cover up such enormous conceit, nor could it hide the sin of being a parasite living on the common people.\n\nThe god disappeared into the arena. Vivenna waited, thinking for a time about her own BioChroma and what it meant. She was completely shocked when a man beside her suddenly lifted off the ground.\n\nThe man rose into the air, lifted by his unusually long cloak. The cloth had stiffened, looking a little like a hand as it held the man up high so he could see over the crowd. How does it do that? She\u2019d been told that Breath could give life to objects, but what did \u201clife\u201d mean? It seemed as if the fibers in the cloak were taut, like muscles, but how did it lift something so much heavier than it was?\n\nThe man descended to the ground. He muttered something Vivenna couldn\u2019t hear, and his BioChromatic aura grew stronger as he recovered his Breath from the cloak. \u201cWe should be moving again soon,\u201d the man said to his friends. \u201cThe crowd is thinning up ahead.\u201d\n\nIndeed, soon the crowd started to progress. It wasn\u2019t long before Vivenna and Parlin entered the arena itself. They moved through the stone benches, choosing a place that wasn\u2019t too crowded, and Vivenna looked urgently through the boxes set above. The building was ornate, but not really very big, and so it didn\u2019t take her long to locate Siri.\n\nWhen she did, her heart sank. My . . . sister, Vivenna thought with a chill. My poor sister.\nSiri was dressed in a scandalous golden dress that didn\u2019t even come down to her knees. It also had a plunging neckline. Siri\u2019s hair, which even she should have been able to keep a dark brown, was instead the golden yellow of enjoyment, and there were deep red ribbons woven through it. She was being attended by dozens of servants.\n\n\u201cLook what they\u2019ve done to her,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cShe must be frightened senseless, forced to wear something like that, forced to keep her hair a color that matches her clothing . . .\u201d Forced to be slave to the God King.\n\nParlin\u2019s square-jawed face grew hard. He didn\u2019t often get angry, but Vivenna could see it in him now. She agreed. Siri was being exploited; they were carrying her around and displaying her like some kind of trophy. It seemed to Vivenna a statement. They were saying they could take a chaste, innocent Idrian woman and do whatever they wished with her.\n\nWhat I\u2019m doing is right, Vivenna thought with growing determination. Coming to Hallandren was the best thing to do. Lemex might be dead, but I have to press onward. I have to find a way.\n\nI have to save my sister.\n\n\u201cVivenna?\u201d Parlin said.\n\n\u201cHum?\u201d Vivenna asked, distracted.\n\n\u201cWhy is everyone starting to bow?\u201d\n\n\n\nSiri played idly with one of the tassels on her dress. The final god was seating himself in his box.That\u2019s twenty-five, she thought. That should be all of them.\n\nSuddenly, out in the audience, people began to rise, then kneel to the ground. Siri stood, searching anxiously. What was she missing? Had the God King arrived, or was this something else? Even the gods had gone down on their knees, though they didn\u2019t prostrate themselves as the mortals did. They all seemed to be bowing toward Siri. Some sort of ritual greeting for their new queen?\n\nThen she saw it. Her dress exploded with color, the stone at her feet gained luster, and her very skin became more vibrant. In front of her, a white serving bowl began to shine; then it seemed to stretch, the white color splitting into the colors of the rainbow.\n\nA serving woman tugged on Siri\u2019s sleeve from where she knelt below. \u201cVessel,\u201d the woman whispered, \u201cbehind you!\u201d\n\nBreath catching in her chest, Siri turned. She found him standing behind her, though she had no idea how he had arrived. There was no entrance back there, just the stone wall.\n\nHe wore white. She hadn\u2019t expected that. Something about his BioChroma made the pure white split as she\u2019d seen before, breaking up like light passed through a prism. Now, in daylight, she could finally see this properly. His clothing seemed to stretch, forming a robe-shaped rainbow in a colorful aura around him.\nAnd he was young. Far younger than her shadowed meetings had suggested. He had supposedly reigned in Hallandren for decades, yet the man standing behind her appeared to be no more than twenty. She stared at him, awed, mouth opening slightly, and any words she had planned to say escaped her. This man was a god. The very air distorted around him. How could she have not seen it? How could she possibly have treated him as she had? She felt like a fool.\n\nHe regarded her, expression blank and unreadable, face so controlled that he reminded Siri of Vivenna. Vivenna. She wouldn\u2019t have been so belligerent. She would have deserved marriage to such a majestic creature.\n\nThe serving woman hissed quietly, tugging again at Siri\u2019s dress. Belatedly, Siri dropped to her knees on the stone, the long train of her dress flapping slightly in the wind behind her.\n\n\n\nBlushweaver knelt obediently on her cushion. Lightsong, however, remained standing, looking across the stadium toward a man he could barely see. The God King wore white, as he often did, for dramatic effect. As the only being to have achieved the Tenth Heightening, the God King had such a strong aura that he could draw color even from something colorless.\n\nBlushweaver glanced up at Lightsong.\n\n\u201cWhy do we kneel?\u201d Lightsong asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our king!\u201d Blushweaver hissed. \u201cDrop down, fool.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will happen if I don\u2019t?\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cThey can\u2019t execute me. I\u2019m a god.\u201d \u201cYou could hurt our cause!\u201d\n\n\u201cOur cause\u201d? Lightsong thought. One meeting and I\u2019m already part of her plans?\n\nHowever, he wasn\u2019t so foolish that he would needlessly earn the God King\u2019s ire. Why risk his perfect life, full of people who would carry his chair through the rain and shell his nuts for him? He knelt down on his cushion. The God King\u2019s superiority was arbitrary, much like Lightsong\u2019s divinity\u2014both part of a grand game of make-believe.\n\nBut he\u2019d found that imaginary things were often the only items of real substance in people\u2019s lives.\n\n\n\nSiri breathed quickly, kneeling on the stone before her husband. The entire arena was hushed and still. Eyes downcast, she could still see Susebron\u2019s white-clothed feet in front of her. Even they gave off an aura of color, the white straps of his sandals bending out colorful ribbons.\n\nTwo coils of colorful rope hit the ground on either side of the God King. Siri watched as the ropes twisted with a life of their own, carefully wrapping around Susebron and pulling him into the air. His white robes fluttered as he was towed up through the space between the canopy and the back wall. Siri leaned forward, watching the ropes deliver her husband to a stone outcropping above. He sat back into a golden throne. Beside him, a pair of Awakener priests commanded their living ropes to roll up around their arms and shoulders.\nThe God King stretched out his hand. The people stood up\u2014their chatter beginning again\u2014and reseated themselves. So . . . he\u2019s not going to sit with me, she thought as she rose. A part of her was relieved, though another was just as frustrated. She\u2019d been getting over her awe of being in Hallandren and being married to a god. Now he\u2019d gone and impressed her all over again. Troubled, she sat and stared out over the crowds, barely watching as a group of priests entered the arena below.\n\nWhat was she to make of Susebron? He couldn\u2019t be a god. Not really. Could he?\n\nAustre was the true God of men, the one who sent the Returned. The Hallandren had worshipped him too, before the Manywar and the exile of the royal family. Only after that had they fallen, becoming pagans, worshipping the Iridescent Tones: BioChromatic Breath, the Returned, and art in general.\n\nAnd yet, Siri had never seen Austre. She\u2019d been taught about him, but what was one to make of a creature like the God King? That divine halo of color wasn\u2019t something that she could ignore. She began to understand just how the people of Hallandren\u2014after nearly being destroyed by their enemies, then being saved by the diplomatic skills of Peacegiver the Blessed\u2014could look to the Returned for divine guidance.\n\nShe sighed, glancing to the side as a figure walked up the steps toward her box. It was Bluefingers\u2014 hands stained with ink, characteristically scribbling away on a ledger even as he entered her pavilion. He glanced up at the God King, nodded to himself, then made another annotation on his ledger. \u201cI see that His Immortal Majesty is positioned and that you are properly displayed, Vessel.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisplayed?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Bluefingers said. \u201cThat is the main purpose of your visit here. The Returned didn\u2019t get much of a chance to see you when you first came to us.\u201d\n\nSiri shivered, trying to maintain a better posture. \u201cShouldn\u2019t they be paying attention to the priests down there? Instead of studying me, I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d Bluefingers said, not looking up from his ledger. \u201cIn my experience, they rarely do what they\u2019re supposed to.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem particularly reverent toward them.\n\nSiri let the conversation lapse, thinking. Bluefingers had never explained his odd warning the other night. Things are not what they seem. \u201cBluefingers,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout the thing you told me the other night. The\u2014\u201d\n\nHe immediately shot her a look\u2014eyes wide and insistent\u2014cutting her off. He turned back to his ledger.\n\nThe message was obvious. Not right now.\n\nSiri sighed, resisting the urge to slump down. Below, priests of various colors stood on short platforms, debating despite the drizzling rain. She could hear them quite well, yet little of what they said made sense to her\u2014the current debate appeared to have something to do with the way refuse and sewage was handled in the city.\n\n\u201cBluefingers,\u201d she asked. \u201cAre they really gods?\u201d\n\nThe scribe hesitated, then finally looked up from his ledger. \u201cVessel?\u201d\n\u201cThe Returned. Do you really think that they\u2019re divine? That they can see the future?\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right one to ask, Vessel. Let me fetch one of the priests. He can answer your questions. Just give me a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Siri said, causing him to stop. \u201cI don\u2019t want a priest\u2019s opinion\u2014I want the opinion of a regular person, like you. A typical follower.\u201d\n\nBluefingers frowned. \u201cAll apologies, Vessel, but I\u2019m not a follower of the Returned.\u201d \u201cBut you work in the palace.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you live there, Vessel. Yet neither of us worship the Iridescent Tones. You are from Idris. I am from Pahn Kahl.\u201d\n\n\u201cPahn Kahl is the same as Hallandren.\u201d\n\nBluefingers raised an eyebrow, pursing his lips. \u201cActually, Vessel, it\u2019s quite different.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019re ruled by the God King.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can accept him as king without worshipping him as our god,\u201d Bluefingers said. \u201cThat is one of the reasons why I\u2019m a steward in the palace instead of a priest.\u201d\n\nHis robes, Siri thought. Maybe that\u2019s why he always wears brown. She turned, glancing down at the priests upon their pedestals in the sand. Each wore a different set of colors, each representing\u2014she assumed\u2014a different one of the Returned. \u201cSo what do you think of them?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood people,\u201d Bluefingers said, \u201cbut misguided. A little like I think of you, Vessel.\u201d\n\nShe glanced at him. He, however, had already turned back to his ledgers. He wasn\u2019t the easiest man with whom to have a conversation. \u201cBut how do you explain the God King\u2019s radiance?\u201d\n\n\u201cBioChroma,\u201d Bluefingers said, still scribbling, not sounding at all annoyed by her questions. He was obviously a man accustomed to dealing with interruption.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the Returned don\u2019t bend white into colors like he does, do they?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bluefingers said, \u201cindeed they do not. They, however, don\u2019t hold the wealth of Breaths that he does.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he is different,\u201d Siri said. \u201cWhy was he born with more?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t, Vessel. The God King\u2019s power does not derive from the inherent BioChroma of being a Returned\u2014in that, he is identical to the others. However, he holds something else. The Light of Peace, they call it. A fancy word for a treasure trove of Breath that numbers somewhere in the tens of thousands.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands? Siri thought. \u201cThat much?\u201d\n\nBluefingers nodded distractedly. \u201cThe God Kings are said to be the only ones to ever achieve the Tenth Heightening. That is what makes light fracture around him, as well as gives him other abilities. The ability to break Lifeless Commands, for instance, or the ability to Awaken objects without touching\nthem, using only the sound of his voice. These powers are less a function of divinity, and more a simple matter of holding so much Breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where did he get it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of it was originally gathered by Peacegiver the Blessed,\u201d Bluefingers said. \u201cHe collected thousands of Breaths during the days of the Manywar. He passed those on to the first Hallandren God King. That inheritance has been transferred from father to son for centuries\u2014and has been enlarged, since each God King is given two Breaths a week, instead of the one that the other Returned receive.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Siri said, sitting back, finding herself oddly disappointed by the news. Susebron was not a god, he was simply a man with far more BioChroma than normal.\n\nBut . . . what of the Returned themselves? Siri folded her arms again, still troubled. She\u2019d never been forced to look objectively at what she believed. Austre was simply . . . well, God. You didn\u2019t question people when they talked about God. The Returned were usurpers, who had cast the followers of Austre out of Hallandren, not true deities themselves.\n\nYet they were so majestic. Why had the royal family been cast out of Hallandren? She knew the official story taught in Idris\u2014that the royals hadn\u2019t supported the conflicts that led up to the Manywar. For that, the people had revolted against them. That revolt had been led by Kalad the Usurper.\n\nKalad. Though Siri had avoided most of her tutorial sessions, even she knew the stories of that man. He was the one who had led the people of Hallandren in the heresy of building Lifeless. He had created a powerful army of the creatures, one the likes of which had never been seen in the land. The stories said Kalad\u2019s Lifeless had been more dangerous, new and distinctive. Terrible and destructive. He\u2019d eventually been defeated by Peacegiver, who had then ended the Manywar through diplomacy.\n\nThe stories said that Kalad\u2019s armies were still out there, somewhere. Waiting to sweep down and destroy again. She knew that story was just a legend told by hearthlight, but it still gave her shivers to consider.\n\nRegardless, Peacegiver had seized control and stopped the Manywar. However, he had not restored Hallandren to its rightful rulers. Idris\u2019s histories claimed betrayal and treachery. The monks spoke of heresies that were too deeply ingrained in Hallandren.\n\nSurely the Hallandren people had their own version of the story. Watching the Returned in their boxes made Siri wonder. One fact was obvious: Things in Hallandren were a whole lot less terrible than she had been taught.\n\n\n\nVivenna shivered, cringing as the people in their colorful outfits crowded around her.\n\nThings here are worse, even, than my tutors said, she decided, wriggling in her seat. Parlin seemed to have lost much of his nervousness about being in such a crowd. He was focused on the debating priests on the floor of the arena.\n\nShe still couldn\u2019t decide if she thought the Breath she held was horrible or wonderful. Gradually, she was coming to appreciate that it was horrible because of how wonderful it felt. The more people that\nsurged around her, the more overwhelmed she felt by her Breath-heightened perception of them. Surely if Parlin only could sense the sheer scope of all those colors, he wouldn\u2019t gawk so dumbly at the costumes. Surely if he could feel the people, he would feel boxed in as she did, unable to breathe.\n\nThat\u2019s it, she thought. I\u2019ve seen Siri, and I know what they\u2019ve done with her. It\u2019s time to go. Turning, she stood. And froze.\n\nA man was standing two rows back, and he was staring directly at Vivenna. She normally wouldn\u2019t have paid him any attention. He was wearing ragged brown clothing, ripped in places, his loose trousers tied at the waist by a simple rope. His facial hair was halfway between being a beard and just scruff. His hair was unkempt and came down to his shoulders.\n\nAnd he created a bubble of color around him so bright that he had to be of the Fifth Heightening. He stared at her, meeting her eyes, and she had a sudden and awful panicked sense that he knew exactly who she was.\n\nShe stumbled back. The strange man didn\u2019t take his eyes off of her. He shifted, pushing back his cloak and exposing a large, black-hilted sword at his belt. Few people in Hallandren wore weapons. This man didn\u2019t seem to care. How had he gotten that thing into the court? The people to the sides gave him a wide berth, and Vivenna swore she could sense something about that sword. It seemed to darken colors. Deepen them. Make tans into browns, reds into maroons, blues into navies. As if it had its own BioChroma . . .\n\n\u201cParlin,\u201d she said, more sharply than she\u2019d intended. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Vivenna said, turning and rushing away. Her newfound BioChromatic senses informed her that the man\u2019s eyes were still on her. Now that she realized it, she understood that his eyes on her were probably what had made her so uncomfortable in the first place.\n\nThe tutors spoke of this, she thought as she and Parlin made their way to one of the stone exit passages. Life sense, the ability to tell when there are people nearby, and to tell when they\u2019re watching you. Everyone has it to a small degree. BioChroma enhances that.\n\nAs soon as they entered the passage, the sense of being watched vanished, and Vivenna let out a relieved breath.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why you wanted to leave,\u201d Parlin said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen what we needed to,\u201d Vivenna said.\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Parlin said. \u201cI thought you might want to listen to what the priests were saying about Idris.\u201d Vivenna froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nParlin frowned, looking distraught. \u201cI think they might be declaring war. Don\u2019t we have a treaty?\u201d Lord God of Colors! Vivenna thought, turning and scrambling back up into the open arena.\n\u201c. . . still say that we cannot possibly justify military action against Idris!\u201d a priest shouted. The man wore blue and gold. It was Stillmark\u2019s high priest\u2014Lightsong couldn\u2019t quite remember the man\u2019s name. Nanrovah?\n\nThe argument was not unexpected. Lightsong leaned forward. Nanrovah and his master, Stillmark, were both staunch traditionalists. They tended to argue against pretty much every proposal, but were well respected. Stillmark was nearly as old as Blushweaver, and was considered wise. Lightsong rubbed his chin.\n\nOpposing Nanrovah was Blushweaver\u2019s own high priestess, Inhanna. \u201cOh, come now,\u201d the woman said from the sands down below. \u201cDo we really need to have this argument again? Idris is nothing more than a rebel enclave set up inside the borders of our own kingdom!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey keep to themselves,\u201d Nanrovah said. \u201cHolding lands we don\u2019t want anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cLands we don\u2019t want?\u201d Blushweaver\u2019s priestess said, sputtering. \u201cThey hold every single pass to the northern kingdoms! Every workable copper mine! They have military garrisons within striking distance of T\u2019Telir! And they still claim to be ruled by the rightful kings of Hallandren!\u201d\n\nNanrovah fell silent, and there was a surprisingly large rumble of assent from the watching priests.\n\nLightsong eyed them. \u201cYou\u2019ve seeded the group with people sympathetic to your cause?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Blushweaver said. \u201cSo did the others. I just did a better job.\u201d\n\nThe debate continued, other priests stepping up to argue for and against an assault on Idris. The priests spoke the concerns of the people of the nation; part of their duty was to listen to the people and study issues of national import, then discuss them here so that the gods\u2014who didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go out among the people\u2014could be kept informed. If an issue came to a head, the gods would make their judgments. They were divided into subgroups, each having responsibility for a certain area. Some gods were in charge of civic issues; others governed agreements and treaties.\n\nIdris was not a new topic for the assembly. However, Lightsong had never seen the discussion become so explicit and extreme. Sanctions had been discussed. Blockades. Even some military pressure. But war? Nobody had said the word yet, but they all knew what the priests were discussing.\n\nHe could not dispel the images from his dreams\u2014visions of death and pain. He did not accept them as prophetic, but he did acknowledge that they must have something to do with the worries inside his subconscious. He feared what war would do to them. Perhaps he was just a coward. It did seem that suppressing Idris would solve so much.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re behind this debate, aren\u2019t you,\u201d he said, turning to Blushweaver.\n\n\u201cBehind it?\u201d Blushweaver said sweetly. \u201cDear Lightsong, the priests decide the issues to be discussed. Gods don\u2019t bother with such mundanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Lightsong said, reclining. \u201cYou want my Lifeless Commands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d Blushweaver said, \u201cI just want you to be informed should you . . .\u201d She trailed off as Lightsong gave her a flat look.\n\u201cAw, Colors,\u201d she swore. \u201cOf course I need your Commands, Lightsong. Why else would I go to all the trouble to get you up here? You\u2019re a very difficult person to manipulate, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just have to promise me that I won\u2019t have to do a thing, and then I\u2019ll do anything you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything that doesn\u2019t require doing anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s something!\u201d\n\nBlushweaver rolled her eyes.\n\nLightsong was more troubled than he let on. The arguments for attack had never been so strong. There was proof of a military buildup in Idris and the highlanders had been particularly stingy with the northern passes lately. Beyond that, there was a growing belief that the Returned were weaker than they\u2019d been in previous generations. Not less powerful in BioChroma, just less . . . divine. Less benevolent, less wise. Lightsong happened to agree.\n\nIt had been three years since a Returned had given up his or her life to heal someone. The people were growing impatient with their gods. \u201cThere\u2019s more, isn\u2019t there?\u201d he said, glancing at Blushweaver, who was still lounging back, delicately eating cherries. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t they saying?\u201d\n\n\u201cLightsong, dear,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were right. Bring you to government proceedings, and it absolutely corrupts you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like secrets,\u201d he said. \u201cThey make my brain itch, keep me awake at nights. Engaging in politics is like pulling off a bandage\u2014best to get the pain over with quickly.\u201d\n\nBlushweaver pursed her lips. \u201cForced simile, dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cBest I can do at the moment, I\u2019m afraid. Nothing dulls the wit more quickly than politics. Now, you were saying . . .\u201d\n\nShe snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve told you already. The focus of all this is that woman.\u201d \u201cThe queen,\u201d he said, glancing at the God King\u2019s box.\n\n\u201cThey sent the wrong one,\u201d Blushweaver said. \u201cThe younger instead of the elder.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cClever of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cClever?\u201d Blushweaver said. \u201cIt\u2019s downright brilliant. Do you know what a fortune we paid these last twenty years to spy upon, study, and learn about the eldest daughter? Those of us who thought to be careful even studied the second daughter, the one they\u2019ve made a monk. But the youngest? Nobody gave her half a thought.\u201d\nAnd so the Idrians send a random element into court, Lightsong thought. One that upsets plans and conniving that our politicians have been working on for decades.\n\nIt was brilliant.\n\n\u201cNobody knows anything about her,\u201d Blushweaver said, frowning deeply. She obviously did not like being taken by surprise. \u201cMy spies in Idris insist the girl is of little consequence\u2014which makes me worry that she is even more dangerous than I\u2019d feared.\u201d\n\nLightsong raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t think, maybe, that you might be overreacting a tad?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Blushweaver asked. \u201cAnd tell me, what would you do if you wanted to inject an agent into the court? Would you, perhaps, set up a decoy that you could display, drawing attention away from the real agent, whom you could train secretly with a clandestine agenda?\u201d\n\nLightsong rubbed his chin. She has a point. Maybe. Living among so many scheming people tended to make one see plots everywhere. However, the plot that Blushweaver suggested had a very serious chance of being dangerous. What better way to get an assassin close to the God King than to send someone to marry him?\n\nNo, that wouldn\u2019t be it. Killing the God King would just cause Hallandren to go on the rampage. But if they\u2019d sent a woman skilled in the art of manipulation\u2014a woman who could secretly poison the mind of the God King . . .\n\n\u201cWe need to be ready to act,\u201d Blushweaver said. \u201cI won\u2019t sit and let my kingdom be pulled out from under me\u2014I won\u2019t idly be cast out as the royals once were. You control a fourth of our Lifeless. That\u2019s ten thousand soldiers who don\u2019t need to eat, who can march tirelessly. If we convince the other three with Commands to join us . . .\u201d\n\nLightsong thought for a moment, then nodded and stood.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Blushweaver asked, sitting up.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll go for a stroll,\u201d Lightsong said.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\nLightsong glanced over at the queen.\n\n\u201cOh, blessed Colors,\u201d Blushweaver said with a sigh. \u201cLightsong, do not ruin this. We walk a very delicate line, here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I can talk you out of interacting with her?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d Lightsong said, glancing backward. \u201cI at least have to chat with her. Nothing would be more intolerable than being overthrown by a person with whom I\u2019d never even had a nice conversation.\u201d\n\nBluefingers wandered off sometime during the court proceedings. Siri didn\u2019t notice\u2014she was too busy watching the priests debate.\n\nShe had to be misunderstanding. Surely they couldn\u2019t be thinking about attacking Idris. What would be the point? What would Hallandren gain? As the priests finished their discussion on that topic, Siri turned to one of her serving women. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d\n\nThe woman glanced down, not answering.\n\n\u201cThey sounded like they were discussing war,\u201d Siri said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t really invade, would they?\u201d\n\nThe woman shuffled uncomfortably, then glanced at one of her companions. That woman rushed away. A few moments later, the servant returned with Treledees. Siri frowned slightly. She did not like speaking with the man.\n\n\u201cYes, Vessel?\u201d the tall man said, eyeing her with his usual air of disdain.\n\nShe swallowed, refusing to be intimidated. \u201cThe priests,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat were they just discussing?\u201d \u201cYour homeland of Idris, Vessel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that much,\u201d Siri said. \u201cWhat do they want with Idris?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seemed to me, Vessel, that they were arguing about whether or not to attack the rebel province and bring it back under proper royal control.\u201d\n\n\u201cRebel province?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Vessel. Your people are in a state of rebellion against the rest of the kingdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you rebelled against us!\u201d\n\nTreledees raised an eyebrow.\n\nDifferent viewpoints on history indeed, Siri thought. \u201cI can see how somebody might think as you do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut . . . you wouldn\u2019t really attack us, would you? We sent you a queen, just as you demanded. Because of that, the next God King will have royal blood.\u201d\n\nAssuming the current God King ever decides to consummate our marriage. . . .\n\nTreledees simply shrugged. \u201cIt is likely nothing, Vessel. The gods simply needed to be apprised of the current political climate of T\u2019Telir.\u201d\n\nHis words didn\u2019t offer Siri much comfort. She shivered. Should she be doing something? Trying to politic in Idris\u2019s defense?\n\n\u201cVessel,\u201d Treledees said.\n\nShe glanced at him. His peaked hat was so tall it brushed the top of the canopy. In a city full of colors and beauty, for some reason Treledees\u2019s long face seemed even bleaker for the contrast. \u201cYes?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cThere is a matter of some delicacy I fear that I must discuss with you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are familiar with monarchies,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, you are the daughter of a king. I assume that you know how important it is to a government that there be a secure, stable plan for succession.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore,\u201d Treledees said, \u201cyou realize that it is of no small importance that an heir be provided as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nSiri blushed. \u201cWe\u2019re working on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all due respect, Vessel,\u201d Treledees said. \u201cThere is some degree of disagreement upon whether or not you actually are.\u201d\n\nSiri blushed further, hair reddening as she glanced away from those callous eyes.\n\n\u201cSuch arguments, of course, are limited to those inside the palace,\u201d Treledees said. \u201cYou can trust in the discretion of our staff and priests.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Siri said, looking up. \u201cI mean, about us. Maybe we are . . . working on it. Maybe you\u2019ll have your heir before you know it.\u201d\n\nTreledees blinked once, slowly, regarding her as if she were a ledger to be added up and accounted. \u201cVessel,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you honestly think that we would take an unfamiliar, foreign woman and place her in close proximity to our most holy of gods without keeping watch?\u201d\n\nSiri felt her breath catch, and she had a moment of horror. Of course! she thought. Of course they were watching. To make sure I didn\u2019t hurt the God King, to make certain things went according to plan.\n\nBeing naked before her husband was bad enough. To be so exposed before men like Treledees\u2014men who saw her not as a woman, but as an annoyance\u2014felt even worse, somehow. She found herself slouching, arms wrapping around her chest and its revealing neckline.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Treledees said, leaning in. \u201cWe understand that the God King may not be what you expected. He may even be . . . difficult to work with. You are a woman, however, and should know how to use your charms to motivate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can I \u2018motivate\u2019 if I can\u2019t talk to him or look at him?\u201d she snapped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a way,\u201d Treledees said. \u201cYou only have one task in this palace. You want to make certain Idris is protected? Well, give the God King\u2019s priesthood what we desire, and your rebels will earn our appreciation. My colleagues and I have no small influence in the court, and we can do much to safeguard your homeland. All we ask is that you perform this single duty. Give us an heir. Give the kingdom stability. Not everything in Hallandren is as . . . cohesive as it may appear to you at first.\u201d\n\nSiri remained slouched down, not looking at Treledees.\n\n\u201cI see that you understand,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that . . .\u201d He trailed off, turning to the side. A procession was approaching Siri\u2019s box. Its members wore gold and red, and a tall figure at the front caused them to shine with vibrant color.\nTreledees frowned, then glanced at her. \u201cWe will speak further, if it becomes necessary. Do your duty, Vessel. Or there will be consequences.\u201d\n\nWith that, the priest withdrew.\n\n\n\nShe didn\u2019t look dangerous. That, more than anything else, made Lightsong inclined to believe Blushweaver\u2019s concerns. I\u2019ve been in the court for far too long, he thought to himself as he smiled pleasantly at the queen. All my life, actually.\n\nShe was a small thing, much younger than he had expected. Barely a woman. She looked intimidated as he nodded to her, waiting while his priests arranged furniture for him. Then he sat, accepting some grapes from the queen\u2019s serving women, even though he wasn\u2019t hungry.\n\n\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d The girl hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cFigure of speech, my dear,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cA rather redundant one\u2014which is quite appropriate, since I am a rather redundant person.\u201d\n\nThe girl cocked her head. Colors, Lightsong thought, remembering that she\u2019d just finished with her period of isolation. I\u2019m probably the only Returned that she\u2019s met besides the God King. What a bad first impression. Still, there was nothing to be done about it. Lightsong was who he was. Whoever that was.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to make your acquaintance, Your Grace,\u201d the queen said slowly. She turned as a serving woman whispered his name to her. \u201cLightsong the Brave, Lord of Heroes,\u201d she said, smiling at him.\n\nThere was a hesitancy about her. Either she had not been trained for formal situations\u2014which Lightsong found difficult to believe, since she\u2019d been raised in a palace\u2014or she was a quite a good actress. He frowned inwardly.\n\nThe woman\u2019s arrival should have put an end to the discussions of war, but instead she had only exacerbated them. He kept his eyes open, for he feared the images of destruction he would see flashing inside his mind\u2019s eye if he so much as blinked. They waited like Kalad\u2019s Phantoms, hovering just beyond his vision.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t accept those dreams as foretellings. If he did, it meant that he was a god. And if that were the case, then he feared greatly for them all.\n\nOn the outside, he simply gave the queen his third most charming smile and popped a grape into his mouth. \u201cNo need to be so formal, Your Majesty. You will soon realize that among Returned, I am by far the least. If cows could Return, they\u2019d undoubtedly be ranked higher than I.\u201d\n\nShe wavered again, obviously uncertain how to deal with him. It was a common reaction. \u201cMight I inquire as to the nature of your visitation?\u201d she asked.\nToo formal. Not at ease. Uncomfortable around those of high rank. Could it be possible that\n\nshe was genuine? No. It was likely an act to put him at ease. To make him underestimate her. Or was he just thinking too much?\n\nColors take you, Blushweaver! he thought. I really don\u2019t want to be part of this.\n\nHe almost withdrew. But, then, that wouldn\u2019t be very pleasant of him\u2014and contrary to some of the things he said, Lightsong did like being pleasant. Best to be kind, he thought, smiling idly to himself. That way, if she ever does take over the kingdom, perhaps she\u2019ll behead me last. \u201cYou ask after the nature of my visitation?\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it has no nature, Your Majesty, other than to appear natural\u2014at which I have already failed by staring at you for far too long while thinking to myself about your place in this mess.\u201d\n\nThe queen frowned again.\n"], "title": ["Warbreaker"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson"]}
