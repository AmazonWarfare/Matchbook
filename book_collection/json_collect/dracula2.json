Then I began to notice that there were some\nquaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were\nlike the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in\nclusters in a nebulous sort of way. I watched them with a sense of\nsoothing, and a sort of calm stole over me. I leaned back in the\nembrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more\nfully the a\u00ebrial gambolling.\n\nSomething made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere far\nbelow in the valley, which was hidden from my sight. Louder it seemed to\nring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to\nthe sound as they danced in the moonlight. I felt myself struggling to\nawake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul was struggling,\nand my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call. I\nwas becoming hypnotised! Quicker and quicker danced the dust; the\nmoonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom\nbeyond. More and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom\nshapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my\nsenses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were\nbecoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the\nthree ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat\nsafer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp\nwas burning brightly.\n\nWhen a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the\nCount's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then\nthere was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a\nbeating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and\ncould do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.\n\nAs I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a\nwoman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between\nthe bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her\nhands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning\nagainst a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she\nthrew herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--\n\n\"Monster, give me my child!\"\n\nShe threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same\nwords in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her\nbreast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant\nemotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see\nher, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.\n\nSomewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the\nCount calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be\nanswered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes\nhad passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,\nthrough the wide entrance into the courtyard.\n\nThere was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but\nshort. Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.\n\nI could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and\nshe was better dead.\n\nWhat shall I do? what can I do? How can I escape from this dreadful\nthing of night and gloom and fear?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night\nhow sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be. When the\nsun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great\ngateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me\nas if the dove from the ark had lighted there. My fear fell from me as\nif it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth. I must\ntake action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me. Last\nnight one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that fatal\nseries which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the\nearth.\n\nLet me not think of it. Action!\n\nIt has always been at night-time that I have been molested or\nthreatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the\nCount in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that\nhe may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room!\nBut there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.\n\nYes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone\nwhy may not another body go? I have seen him myself crawl from his\nwindow. Why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window? The\nchances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still. I shall risk\nit. At the worst it can only be death; and a man's death is not a\ncalf's, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me. God help me\nin my task! Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and\nsecond father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and God, helping me, have\ncome safely back to this room. I must put down every detail in order. I\nwent whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south\nside, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs\naround the building on this side. The stones are big and roughly cut,\nand the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them. I\ntook off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way. I looked down\nonce, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would\nnot overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it. I knew pretty\nwell the direction and distance of the Count's window, and made for it\nas well as I could, having regard to the opportunities available. I did\nnot feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and the time seemed\nridiculously short till I found myself standing on the window-sill and\ntrying to raise up the sash. I was filled with agitation, however, when\nI bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window. Then I looked\naround for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery.\nThe room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which\nseemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same\nstyle as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked\nfor the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it\nanywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one\ncorner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and\nHungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as\nthough it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was\nless than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,\nsome jewelled, but all of them old and stained.\n\nAt one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I\ncould not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which\nwas the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or\nall my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone\npassage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,\nminding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit\nby loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,\ntunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the\nodour of old earth newly turned. As I went through the passage the smell\ngrew closer and heavier. At last I pulled open a heavy door which stood\najar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had evidently\nbeen used as a graveyard. The roof was broken, and in two places were\nsteps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been dug over, and\nthe earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those which had been\nbrought by the Slovaks. There was nobody about, and I made search for\nany further outlet, but there was none. Then I went over every inch of\nthe ground, so as not to lose a chance. I went down even into the\nvaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so was a dread to\nmy very soul. Into two of these I went, but saw nothing except fragments\nof old coffins and piles of dust; in the third, however, I made a\ndiscovery.\n\nThere, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on a\npile of newly dug earth, lay the Count! He was either dead or asleep, I\ncould not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without the\nglassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all\ntheir pallor; the lips were as red as ever. But there was no sign of\nmovement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart. I bent over him,\nand tried to find any sign of life, but in vain. He could not have lain\nthere long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours.\nBy the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes here and there.\nI thought he might have the keys on him, but when I went to search I saw\nthe dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were, such a look of hate,\nthough unconscious of me or my presence, that I fled from the place, and\nleaving the Count's room by the window, crawled again up the castle\nwall. Regaining my room, I threw myself panting upon the bed and tried\nto think....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has\ntaken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave the\ncastle by the same window, and in my clothes. As he went down the wall,\nlizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that I might\ndestroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man's hand would\nhave any effect on him. I dared not wait to see him return, for I feared\nto see those weird sisters. I came back to the library, and read there\ntill I fell asleep.\n\nI was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can\nlook as he said:--\n\n\"To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful\nEngland, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never\nmeet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be\nhere, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the\nSzgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some\nSlovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall\nbear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to\nBistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle\nDracula.\" I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.\nSincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in\nconnection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--\n\n\"Why may I not go to-night?\"\n\n\"Because, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.\"\n\n\"But I would walk with pleasure. I want to get away at once.\" He smiled,\nsuch a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick\nbehind his smoothness. He said:--\n\n\"And your baggage?\"\n\n\"I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.\"\n\nThe Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my\neyes, it seemed so real:--\n\n\"You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is\nthat which rules our _boyars_: 'Welcome the coming; speed the parting\nguest.' Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait\nin my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that\nyou so suddenly desire it. Come!\" With a stately gravity, he, with the\nlamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall. Suddenly he\nstopped.\n\n\"Hark!\"\n\nClose at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the\nsound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great\norchestra seems to leap under the b\u00e2ton of the conductor. After a pause\nof a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back\nthe ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it\nopen.\n\nTo my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I\nlooked all round, but could see no key of any kind.\n\nAs the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder\nand angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed\nfeet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that\nto struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such\nallies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door\ncontinued slowly to open, and only the Count's body stood in the gap.\nSuddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my\ndoom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There\nwas a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and\nas a last chance I cried out:--\n\n\"Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!\" and covered my face with my\nhands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his\npowerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged\nand echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.\n\nIn silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went\nto my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand\nto me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that\nJudas in hell might be proud of.\n\nWhen I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a\nwhispering at my door. I went to it softly and listened. Unless my ears\ndeceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--\n\n\"Back, back, to your own place! Your time is not yet come. Wait! Have\npatience! To-night is mine. To-morrow night is yours!\" There was a low,\nsweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw\nwithout the three terrible women licking their lips. As I appeared they\nall joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.\n\nI came back to my room and threw myself on my knees. It is then so near\nthe end? To-morrow! to-morrow! Lord, help me, and those to whom I am\ndear!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this\ndiary. I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself\non my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me\nready.\n\nAt last I felt that subtle change in the air, and knew that the morning\nhad come. Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.\nWith a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down to the hall. I had seen\nthat the door was unlocked, and now escape was before me. With hands\nthat trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the\nmassive bolts.\n\nBut the door would not move. Despair seized me. I pulled, and pulled, at\nthe door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its\ncasement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the\nCount.\n\nThen a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I\ndetermined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count's\nroom. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of\nevils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled\ndown the wall, as before, into the Count's room. It was empty, but that\nwas as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold\nremained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding\nstair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well\nenough where to find the monster I sought.\n\nThe great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid\nwas laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their\nplaces to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so\nI raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw\nsomething which filled my very soul with horror. There lay the Count,\nbut looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair\nand moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks were fuller,\nand the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth was redder than\never, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which trickled from the\ncorners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck. Even the deep,\nburning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the lids and pouches\nunderneath were bloated. It seemed as if the whole awful creature were\nsimply gorged with blood. He lay like a filthy leech, exhausted with his\nrepletion. I shuddered as I bent over to touch him, and every sense in\nme revolted at the contact; but I had to search, or I was lost. The\ncoming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those\nhorrid three. I felt all over the body, but no sign could I find of the\nkey. Then I stopped and looked at the Count. There was a mocking smile\non the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad. This was the being I\nwas helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come\nhe might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and\ncreate a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the\nhelpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me\nto rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand,\nbut I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the\ncases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the\nhateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell full\nupon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to\nparalyse me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face,\nmerely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my\nhand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade\ncaught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid\nthing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,\nblood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its\nown in the nethermost hell.\n\nI thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed\non fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I\nwaited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming\ncloser, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the\ncracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had\nspoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which\ncontained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's\nroom, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.\nWith strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of the\nkey in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door. There must\nhave been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of\nthe locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and\ndying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to\nrun down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;\nbut at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the\ndoor to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from\nthe lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was\nhopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing\nround me more closely.\n\nAs I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet\nand the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,\nwith their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the\nbox being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again\nalong the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.\n\nThe door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key\nin the lock; I can hear the key withdraw: then another door opens and\nshuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.\n\nHark! in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,\nthe crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the\ndistance.\n\nI am alone in the castle with those awful women. Faugh! Mina is a woman,\nand there is nought in common. They are devils of the Pit!\n\nI shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle wall\nfarther than I have yet attempted. I shall take some of the gold with\nme, lest I want it later. I may find a way from this dreadful place.\n\nAnd then away for home! away to the quickest and nearest train! away\nfrom this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his\nchildren still walk with earthly feet!\n\nAt least God's mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the\nprecipice is steep and high. At its foot a man may sleep--as a man.\nGood-bye, all! Mina!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_Letter from Miss Mina Murray to Miss Lucy Westenra._\n\n\n\"_9 May._\n\n\"My dearest Lucy,--\n\n\"Forgive my long delay in writing, but I have been simply overwhelmed\nwith work. The life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying.\nI am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together\nfreely and build our castles in the air. I have been working very hard\nlately, because I want to keep up with Jonathan's studies, and I have\nbeen practising shorthand very assiduously. When we are married I shall\nbe able to be useful to Jonathan, and if I can stenograph well enough I\ncan take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for\nhim on the typewriter, at which also I am practising very hard. He\nand I sometimes write letters in shorthand, and he is keeping a\nstenographic journal of his travels abroad. When I am with you I\nshall keep a diary in the same way. I don't mean one of those\ntwo-pages-to-the-week-with-Sunday-squeezed-in-a-corner diaries, but a\nsort of journal which I can write in whenever I feel inclined. I do not\nsuppose there will be much of interest to other people; but it is not\nintended for them. I may show it to Jonathan some day if there is in it\nanything worth sharing, but it is really an exercise book. I shall try\nto do what I see lady journalists do: interviewing and writing\ndescriptions and trying to remember conversations. I am told that, with\na little practice, one can remember all that goes on or that one hears\nsaid during a day. However, we shall see. I will tell you of my little\nplans when we meet. I have just had a few hurried lines from Jonathan\nfrom Transylvania. He is well, and will be returning in about a week. I\nam longing to hear all his news. It must be so nice to see strange\ncountries. I wonder if we--I mean Jonathan and I--shall ever see them\ntogether. There is the ten o'clock bell ringing. Good-bye.\n\n\"Your loving\n\n\"MINA.\n\n\"Tell me all the news when you write. You have not told me anything for\na long time. I hear rumours, and especially of a tall, handsome,\ncurly-haired man???\"\n\n\n_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.\n\n\"_17, Chatham Street_,\n\n\"_Wednesday_.\n\n\"My dearest Mina,--\n\n\"I must say you tax me _very_ unfairly with being a bad correspondent. I\nwrote to you _twice_ since we parted, and your last letter was only your\n_second_. Besides, I have nothing to tell you. There is really nothing\nto interest you. Town is very pleasant just now, and we go a good deal\nto picture-galleries and for walks and rides in the park. As to the\ntall, curly-haired man, I suppose it was the one who was with me at the\nlast Pop. Some one has evidently been telling tales. That was Mr.\nHolmwood. He often comes to see us, and he and mamma get on very well\ntogether; they have so many things to talk about in common. We met some\ntime ago a man that would just _do for you_, if you were not already\nengaged to Jonathan. He is an excellent _parti_, being handsome, well\noff, and of good birth. He is a doctor and really clever. Just fancy! He\nis only nine-and-twenty, and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under\nhis own care. Mr. Holmwood introduced him to me, and he called here to\nsee us, and often comes now. I think he is one of the most resolute men\nI ever saw, and yet the most calm. He seems absolutely imperturbable. I\ncan fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients. He has\na curious habit of looking one straight in the face, as if trying to\nread one's thoughts. He tries this on very much with me, but I flatter\nmyself he has got a tough nut to crack. I know that from my glass. Do\nyou ever try to read your own face? _I do_, and I can tell you it is not\na bad study, and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you\nhave never tried it. He says that I afford him a curious psychological\nstudy, and I humbly think I do. I do not, as you know, take sufficient\ninterest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions. Dress is a\nbore. That is slang again, but never mind; Arthur says that every day.\nThere, it is all out. Mina, we have told all our secrets to each other\nsince we were _children_; we have slept together and eaten together, and\nlaughed and cried together; and now, though I have spoken, I would like\nto speak more. Oh, Mina, couldn't you guess? I love him. I am blushing\nas I write, for although I _think_ he loves me, he has not told me so in\nwords. But oh, Mina, I love him; I love him; I love him! There, that\ndoes me good. I wish I were with you, dear, sitting by the fire\nundressing, as we used to sit; and I would try to tell you what I feel.\nI do not know how I am writing this even to you. I am afraid to stop,\nor I should tear up the letter, and I don't want to stop, for I _do_ so\nwant to tell you all. Let me hear from you _at once_, and tell me all\nthat you think about it. Mina, I must stop. Good-night. Bless me in your\nprayers; and, Mina, pray for my happiness.\n\n\"LUCY.\n\n\"P.S.--I need not tell you this is a secret. Good-night again.\n\n\"L.\"\n\n_Letter, Lucy Westenra to Mina Murray_.\n\n\"_24 May_.\n\n\"My dearest Mina,--\n\n\"Thanks, and thanks, and thanks again for your sweet letter. It was so\nnice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy.\n\n\"My dear, it never rains but it pours. How true the old proverbs are.\nHere am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a\nproposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three.\nJust fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn't it awful! I feel sorry,\nreally and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so\nhappy that I don't know what to do with myself. And three proposals!\nBut, for goodness' sake, don't tell any of the girls, or they would be\ngetting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured\nand slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at\nleast. Some girls are so vain! You and I, Mina dear, who are engaged and\nare going to settle down soon soberly into old married women, can\ndespise vanity. Well, I must tell you about the three, but you must keep\nit a secret, dear, from _every one_, except, of course, Jonathan. You\nwill tell him, because I would, if I were in your place, certainly tell\nArthur. A woman ought to tell her husband everything--don't you think\nso, dear?--and I must be fair. Men like women, certainly their wives, to\nbe quite as fair as they are; and women, I am afraid, are not always\nquite as fair as they should be. Well, my dear, number One came just\nbefore lunch. I told you of him, Dr. John Seward, the lunatic-asylum\nman, with the strong jaw and the good forehead. He was very cool\noutwardly, but was nervous all the same. He had evidently been schooling\nhimself as to all sorts of little things, and remembered them; but he\nalmost managed to sit down on his silk hat, which men don't generally do\nwhen they are cool, and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept\nplaying with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream. He spoke to\nme, Mina, very straightforwardly. He told me how dear I was to him,\nthough he had known me so little, and what his life would be with me to\nhelp and cheer him. He was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if I\ndid not care for him, but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute\nand would not add to my present trouble. Then he broke off and asked if\nI could love him in time; and when I shook my head his hands trembled,\nand then with some hesitation he asked me if I cared already for any one\nelse. He put it very nicely, saying that he did not want to wring my\nconfidence from me, but only to know, because if a woman's heart was\nfree a man might have hope. And then, Mina, I felt a sort of duty to\ntell him that there was some one. I only told him that much, and then he\nstood up, and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my\nhands in his and said he hoped I would be happy, and that if I ever\nwanted a friend I must count him one of my best. Oh, Mina dear, I can't\nhelp crying: and you must excuse this letter being all blotted. Being\nproposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing, but it isn't at\nall a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow, whom you know\nloves you honestly, going away and looking all broken-hearted, and to\nknow that, no matter what he may say at the moment, you are passing\nquite out of his life. My dear, I must stop here at present, I feel so\nmiserable, though I am so happy.\n\n\"_Evening._\n\n\"Arthur has just gone, and I feel in better spirits than when I left\noff, so I can go on telling you about the day. Well, my dear, number Two\ncame after lunch. He is such a nice fellow, an American from Texas, and\nhe looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he\nhas been to so many places and has had such adventures. I sympathise\nwith poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her\near, even by a black man. I suppose that we women are such cowards that\nwe think a man will save us from fears, and we marry him. I know now\nwhat I would do if I were a man and wanted to make a girl love me. No, I\ndon't, for there was Mr. Morris telling us his stories, and Arthur never\ntold any, and yet---- My dear, I am somewhat previous. Mr. Quincey P.\nMorris found me alone. It seems that a man always does find a girl\nalone. No, he doesn't, for Arthur tried twice to _make_ a chance, and I\nhelping him all I could; I am not ashamed to say it now. I must tell you\nbeforehand that Mr. Morris doesn't always speak slang--that is to say,\nhe never does so to strangers or before them, for he is really well\neducated and has exquisite manners--but he found out that it amused me\nto hear him talk American slang, and whenever I was present, and there\nwas no one to be shocked, he said such funny things. I am afraid, my\ndear, he has to invent it all, for it fits exactly into whatever else he\nhas to say. But this is a way slang has. I do not know myself if I shall\never speak slang; I do not know if Arthur likes it, as I have never\nheard him use any as yet. Well, Mr. Morris sat down beside me and looked\nas happy and jolly as he could, but I could see all the same that he was\nvery nervous. He took my hand in his, and said ever so sweetly:--\n\n\"'Miss Lucy, I know I ain't good enough to regulate the fixin's of your\nlittle shoes, but I guess if you wait till you find a man that is you\nwill go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit. Won't\nyou just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road\ntogether, driving in double harness?'\n\n\"Well, he did look so good-humoured and so jolly that it didn't seem\nhalf so hard to refuse him as it did poor Dr. Seward; so I said, as\nlightly as I could, that I did not know anything of hitching, and that I\nwasn't broken to harness at all yet. Then he said that he had spoken in\na light manner, and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so\non so grave, so momentous, an occasion for him, I would forgive him. He\nreally did look serious when he was saying it, and I couldn't help\nfeeling a bit serious too--I know, Mina, you will think me a horrid\nflirt--though I couldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he was\nnumber two in one day. And then, my dear, before I could say a word he\nbegan pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very\nheart and soul at my feet. He looked so earnest over it that I shall\nnever again think that a man must be playful always, and never earnest,\nbecause he is merry at times. I suppose he saw something in my face\nwhich checked him, for he suddenly stopped, and said with a sort of\nmanly fervour that I could have loved him for if I had been free:--\n\n\"'Lucy, you are an honest-hearted girl, I know. I should not be here\nspeaking to you as I am now if I did not believe you clean grit, right\nthrough to the very depths of your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow\nto another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is\nI'll never trouble you a hair's breadth again, but will be, if you will\nlet me, a very faithful friend.'\n\n\"My dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy\nof them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true\ngentleman. I burst into tears--I am afraid, my dear, you will think\nthis a very sloppy letter in more ways than one--and I really felt very\nbadly. Why can't they let a girl marry three men, or as many as want\nher, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say\nit. I am glad to say that, though I was crying, I was able to look into\nMr. Morris's brave eyes, and I told him out straight:--\n\n\"'Yes, there is some one I love, though he has not told me yet that he\neven loves me.' I was right to speak to him so frankly, for quite a\nlight came into his face, and he put out both his hands and took mine--I\nthink I put them into his--and said in a hearty way:--\n\n\"'That's my brave girl. It's better worth being late for a chance of\nwinning you than being in time for any other girl in the world. Don't\ncry, my dear. If it's for me, I'm a hard nut to crack; and I take it\nstanding up. If that other fellow doesn't know his happiness, well, he'd\nbetter look for it soon, or he'll have to deal with me. Little girl,\nyour honesty and pluck have made me a friend, and that's rarer than a\nlover; it's more unselfish anyhow. My dear, I'm going to have a pretty\nlonely walk between this and Kingdom Come. Won't you give me one kiss?\nIt'll be something to keep off the darkness now and then. You can, you\nknow, if you like, for that other good fellow--he must be a good fellow,\nmy dear, and a fine fellow, or you could not love him--hasn't spoken\nyet.' That quite won me, Mina, for it _was_ brave and sweet of him, and\nnoble, too, to a rival--wasn't it?--and he so sad; so I leant over and\nkissed him. He stood up with my two hands in his, and as he looked down\ninto my face--I am afraid I was blushing very much--he said:--\n\n\"'Little girl, I hold your hand, and you've kissed me, and if these\nthings don't make us friends nothing ever will. Thank you for your sweet\nhonesty to me, and good-bye.' He wrung my hand, and taking up his hat,\nwent straight out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a\nquiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby. Oh, why must a man like\nthat be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would\nworship the very ground he trod on? I know I would if I were free--only\nI don't want to be free. My dear, this quite upset me, and I feel I\ncannot write of happiness just at once, after telling you of it; and I\ndon't wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy.\n\n\"Ever your loving\n\n\"LUCY.\n\n\"P.S.--Oh, about number Three--I needn't tell you of number Three, need\nI? Besides, it was all so confused; it seemed only a moment from his\ncoming into the room till both his arms were round me, and he was\nkissing me. I am very, very happy, and I don't know what I have done to\ndeserve it. I must only try in the future to show that I am not\nungrateful to God for all His goodness to me in sending to me such a\nlover, such a husband, and such a friend.\n\n\"Good-bye.\"\n\n\n_Dr. Seward's Diary._\n\n(Kept in phonograph)\n\n_25 May._--Ebb tide in appetite to-day. Cannot eat, cannot rest, so\ndiary instead. Since my rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty\nfeeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth\nthe doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was\nwork, I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has\nafforded me a study of much interest. He is so quaint that I am\ndetermined to understand him as well as I can. To-day I seemed to get\nnearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery.\n\nI questioned him more fully than I had ever done, with a view to making\nmyself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing\nit there was, I now see, something of cruelty. I seemed to wish to keep\nhim to the point of his madness--a thing which I avoid with the patients\nas I would the mouth of hell.\n\n(_Mem._, under what circumstances would I _not_ avoid the pit of hell?)\n_Omnia Rom\u00e6 venalia sunt._ Hell has its price! _verb. sap._ If there be\nanything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards\n_accurately_, so I had better commence to do so, therefore--\n\nR. M. Renfield, \u00e6tat 59.--Sanguine temperament; great physical strength;\nmorbidly excitable; periods of gloom, ending in some fixed idea which I\ncannot make out. I presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the\ndisturbing influence end in a mentally-accomplished finish; a possibly\ndangerous man, probably dangerous if unselfish. In selfish men caution\nis as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves. What I think of\non this point is, when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is\nbalanced with the centrifugal; when duty, a cause, etc., is the fixed\npoint, the latter force is paramount, and only accident or a series of\naccidents can balance it.\n\n\n_Letter, Quincey P.

Whitby._--Lucy met me at the station, looking sweeter and\nlovelier than ever, and we drove up to the house at the Crescent in\nwhich they have rooms. This is a lovely place. The little river, the\nEsk, runs through a deep valley, which broadens out as it comes near the\nharbour. A great viaduct runs across, with high piers, through which the\nview seems somehow further away than it really is. The valley is\nbeautifully green, and it is so steep that when you are on the high land\non either side you look right across it, unless you are near enough to\nsee down. The houses of the old town--the side away from us--are all\nred-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the\npictures we see of Nuremberg. Right over the town is the ruin of Whitby\nAbbey, which was sacked by the Danes, and which is the scene of part of\n\"Marmion,\" where the girl was built up in the wall. It is a most noble\nruin, of immense size, and full of beautiful and romantic bits; there is\na legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows. Between it and\nthe town there is another church, the parish one, round which is a big\ngraveyard, all full of tombstones. This is to my mind the nicest spot in\nWhitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the\nharbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness\nstretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that\npart of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been\ndestroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches\nout over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside\nthem, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long\nlooking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze. I shall come and\nsit here very often myself and work. Indeed, I am writing now, with my\nbook on my knee, and listening to the talk of three old men who are\nsitting beside me. They seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and\ntalk.\n\nThe harbour lies below me, with, on the far side, one long granite wall\nstretching out into the sea, with a curve outwards at the end of it, in\nthe middle of which is a lighthouse. A heavy sea-wall runs along outside\nof it. On the near side, the sea-wall makes an elbow crooked inversely,\nand its end too has a lighthouse. Between the two piers there is a\nnarrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.\n\nIt is nice at high water; but when the tide is out it shoals away to\nnothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between\nbanks of sand, with rocks here and there. Outside the harbour on this\nside there rises for about half a mile a great reef, the sharp edge of\nwhich runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse. At the end of\nit is a buoy with a bell, which swings in bad weather, and sends in a\nmournful sound on the wind. They have a legend here that when a ship is\nlost bells are heard out at sea. I must ask the old man about this; he\nis coming this way....\n\nHe is a funny old man. He must be awfully old, for his face is all\ngnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree. He tells me that he is\nnearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing\nfleet when Waterloo was fought. He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical\nperson, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady\nat the abbey he said very brusquely:--\n\n\"I wouldn't fash masel' about them, miss. Them things be all wore out.\nMind, I don't say that they never was, but I do say that they wasn't in\nmy time. They be all very well for comers and trippers, an' the like,\nbut not for a nice young lady like you. Them feet-folks from York and\nLeeds that be always eatin' cured herrin's an' drinkin' tea an' lookin'\nout to buy cheap jet would creed aught. I wonder masel' who'd be\nbothered tellin' lies to them--even the newspapers, which is full of\nfool-talk.\" I thought he would be a good person to learn interesting\nthings from, so I asked him if he would mind telling me something about\nthe whale-fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin\nwhen the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said:--\n\n\"I must gang ageeanwards home now, miss. My grand-daughter doesn't like\nto be kept waitin' when the tea is ready, for it takes me time to\ncrammle aboon the grees, for there be a many of 'em; an', miss, I lack\nbelly-timber sairly by the clock.\"\n\nHe hobbled away, and I could see him hurrying, as well as he could, down\nthe steps. The steps are a great feature on the place. They lead from\nthe town up to the church, there are hundreds of them--I do not know how\nmany--and they wind up in a delicate curve; the slope is so gentle that\na horse could easily walk up and down them. I think they must originally\nhave had something to do with the abbey. I shall go home too. Lucy went\nout visiting with her mother, and as they were only duty calls, I did\nnot go. They will be home by this.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_1 August._--I came up here an hour ago with Lucy, and we had a most\ninteresting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come\nand join him. He is evidently the Sir Oracle of them, and I should think\nmust have been in his time a most dictatorial person. He will not admit\nanything, and downfaces everybody. If he can't out-argue them he bullies\nthem, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy\nwas looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a\nbeautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did\nnot lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down.\nShe is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her\non the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but\ngave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends,\nand he went off at once into a sort of sermon. I must try to remember it\nand put it down:--\n\n\"It be all fool-talk, lock, stock, and barrel; that's what it be, an'\nnowt else. These bans an' wafts an' boh-ghosts an' barguests an' bogles\nan' all anent them is only fit to set bairns an' dizzy women\na-belderin'. They be nowt but air-blebs. They, an' all grims an' signs\nan' warnin's, be all invented by parsons an' illsome beuk-bodies an'\nrailway touters to skeer an' scunner hafflin's, an' to get folks to do\nsomethin' that they don't other incline to. It makes me ireful to think\no' them. Why, it's them that, not content with printin' lies on paper\nan' preachin' them out of pulpits, does want to be cuttin' them on the\ntombstones. Look here all around you in what airt ye will; all them\nsteans, holdin' up their heads as well as they can out of their pride,\nis acant--simply tumblin' down with the weight o' the lies wrote on\nthem, 'Here lies the body' or 'Sacred to the memory' wrote on all of\nthem, an' yet in nigh half of them there bean't no bodies at all; an'\nthe memories of them bean't cared a pinch of snuff about, much less\nsacred. Lies all of them, nothin' but lies of one kind or another! My\ngog, but it'll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they\ncome tumblin' up in their death-sarks, all jouped together an' tryin' to\ndrag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was; some of them\ntrimmlin' and ditherin', with their hands that dozzened an' slippy from\nlyin' in the sea that they can't even keep their grup o' them.\"\n\nI could see from the old fellow's self-satisfied air and the way in\nwhich he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was\n\"showing off,\" so I put in a word to keep him going:--\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Swales, you can't be serious. Surely these tombstones are not\nall wrong?\"\n\n\"Yabblins! There may be a poorish few not wrong, savin' where they make\nout the people too good; for there be folk that do think a balm-bowl be\nlike the sea, if only it be their own. The whole thing be only lies. Now\nlook you here; you come here a stranger, an' you see this kirk-garth.\" I\nnodded, for I thought it better to assent, though I did not quite\nunderstand his dialect. I knew it had something to do with the church.\nHe went on: \"And you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be\nhapped here, snod an' snog?\" I assented again. \"Then that be just where\nthe lie comes in. Why, there be scores of these lay-beds that be toom as\nold Dun's 'bacca-box on Friday night.\" He nudged one of his companions,\nand they all laughed. \"And my gog! how could they be otherwise? Look at\nthat one, the aftest abaft the bier-bank: read it!\" I went over and\nread:--\n\n\"Edward Spencelagh, master mariner, murdered by pirates off the coast of\nAndres, April, 1854, \u00e6t. 30.\" When I came back Mr. Swales went on:--\n\n\"Who brought him home, I wonder, to hap him here? Murdered off the coast\nof Andres! an' you consated his body lay under! Why, I could name ye a\ndozen whose bones lie in the Greenland seas above\"--he pointed\nnorthwards--\"or where the currents may have drifted them. There be the\nsteans around ye. Ye can, with your young eyes, read the small-print of\nthe lies from here. This Braithwaite Lowrey--I knew his father, lost in\nthe _Lively_ off Greenland in '20; or Andrew Woodhouse, drowned in the\nsame seas in 1777; or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year\nlater; or old John Rawlings, whose grandfather sailed with me, drowned\nin the Gulf of Finland in '50. Do ye think that all these men will have\nto make a rush to Whitby when the trumpet sounds? I have me antherums\naboot it! I tell ye that when they got here they'd be jommlin' an'\njostlin' one another that way that it 'ud be like a fight up on the ice\nin the old days, when we'd be at one another from daylight to dark, an'\ntryin' to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis.\" This was\nevidently local pleasantry, for the old man cackled over it, and his\ncronies joined in with gusto.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"surely you are not quite correct, for you start on the\nassumption that all the poor people, or their spirits, will have to\ntake their tombstones with them on the Day of Judgment. Do you think\nthat will be really necessary?\"\n\n\"Well, what else be they tombstones for? Answer me that, miss!\"\n\n\"To please their relatives, I suppose.\"\n\n\"To please their relatives, you suppose!\" This he said with intense\nscorn. \"How will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote\nover them, and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies?\" He\npointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab, on\nwhich the seat was rested, close to the edge of the cliff. \"Read the\nlies on that thruff-stean,\" he said. The letters were upside down to me\nfrom where I sat, but Lucy was more opposite to them, so she leant over\nand read:--\n\n\"Sacred to the memory of George Canon, who died, in the hope of a\nglorious resurrection, on July, 29, 1873, falling from the rocks at\nKettleness. This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly\nbeloved son. 'He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.'\nReally, Mr. Swales, I don't see anything very funny in that!\" She spoke\nher comment very gravely and somewhat severely.\n\n\"Ye don't see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that's because ye don't gawm the\nsorrowin' mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was\nacrewk'd--a regular lamiter he was--an' he hated her so that he\ncommitted suicide in order that she mightn't get an insurance she put on"], "title": ["Dracula"], "author": ["Bram Stoker"]}
