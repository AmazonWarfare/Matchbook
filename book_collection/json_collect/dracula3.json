He has certain qualities very largely developed;\nselfishness, secrecy, and purpose. I wish I could get at what is the\nobject of the latter. He seems to have some settled scheme of his own,\nbut what it is I do not yet know. His redeeming quality is a love of\nanimals, though, indeed, he has such curious turns in it that I\nsometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel. His pets are of odd\nsorts. Just now his hobby is catching flies. He has at present such a\nquantity that I have had myself to expostulate. To my astonishment, he\ndid not break out into a fury, as I expected, but took the matter in\nsimple seriousness. He thought for a moment, and then said: \"May I have\nthree days? I shall clear them away.\" Of course, I said that would do. I\nmust watch him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_18 June._--He has turned his mind now to spiders, and has got several\nvery big fellows in a box. He keeps feeding them with his flies, and\nthe number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished, although he\nhas used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his\nroom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_1 July._--His spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his\nflies, and to-day I told him that he must get rid of them. He looked\nvery sad at this, so I said that he must clear out some of them, at all\nevents. He cheerfully acquiesced in this, and I gave him the same time\nas before for reduction. He disgusted me much while with him, for when a\nhorrid blow-fly, bloated with some carrion food, buzzed into the room,\nhe caught it, held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger\nand thumb, and, before I knew what he was going to do, put it in his\nmouth and ate it. I scolded him for it, but he argued quietly that it\nwas very good and very wholesome; that it was life, strong life, and\ngave life to him. This gave me an idea, or the rudiment of one. I must\nwatch how he gets rid of his spiders. He has evidently some deep problem\nin his mind, for he keeps a little note-book in which he is always\njotting down something. Whole pages of it are filled with masses of\nfigures, generally single numbers added up in batches, and then the\ntotals added in batches again, as though he were \"focussing\" some\naccount, as the auditors put it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_8 July._--There is a method in his madness, and the rudimentary idea in\nmy mind is growing. It will be a whole idea soon, and then, oh,\nunconscious cerebration! you will have to give the wall to your\nconscious brother. I kept away from my friend for a few days, so that I\nmight notice if there were any change. Things remain as they were except\nthat he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one. He has\nmanaged to get a sparrow, and has already partially tamed it. His means\nof taming is simple, for already the spiders have diminished. Those that\ndo remain, however, are well fed, for he still brings in the flies by\ntempting them with his food.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_19 July._--We are progressing. My friend has now a whole colony of\nsparrows, and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated. When I came\nin he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour--a very,\nvery great favour; and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog. I asked\nhim what it was, and he said, with a sort of rapture in his voice and\nbearing:--\n\n\"A kitten, a nice little, sleek playful kitten, that I can play with,\nand teach, and feed--and feed--and feed!\" I was not unprepared for this\nrequest, for I had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and\nvivacity, but I did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows\nshould be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders; so\nI said I would see about it, and asked him if he would not rather have a\ncat than a kitten. His eagerness betrayed him as he answered:--\n\n\"Oh, yes, I would like a cat! I only asked for a kitten lest you should\nrefuse me a cat. No one would refuse me a kitten, would they?\" I shook\nmy head, and said that at present I feared it would not be possible, but\nthat I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of\ndanger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant\nkilling. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him\nwith his present craving and see how it will work out; then I shall know\nmore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_10 p. m._--I have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner\nbrooding. When I came in he threw himself on his knees before me and\nimplored me to let him have a cat; that his salvation depended upon it.\nI was firm, however, and told him that he could not have it, whereupon\nhe went without a word, and sat down, gnawing his fingers, in the corner\nwhere I had found him. I shall see him in the morning early.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_20 July._--Visited Renfield very early, before the attendant went his\nrounds. Found him up and humming a tune. He was spreading out his sugar,\nwhich he had saved, in the window, and was manifestly beginning his\nfly-catching again; and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace. I\nlooked around for his birds, and not seeing them, asked him where they\nwere. He replied, without turning round, that they had all flown away.\nThere were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of\nblood. I said nothing, but went and told the keeper to report to me if\nthere were anything odd about him during the day.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_11 a. m._--The attendant has just been to me to say that Renfield has\nbeen very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers. \"My belief is,\ndoctor,\" he said, \"that he has eaten his birds, and that he just took\nand ate them raw!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_11 p. m._--I gave Renfield a strong opiate to-night, enough to make\neven him sleep, and took away his pocket-book to look at it. The thought\nthat has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete, and the theory\nproved. My homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind. I shall have to\ninvent a new classification for him, and call him a zo\u00f6phagous\n(life-eating) maniac; what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he\ncan, and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way. He\ngave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird, and then\nwanted a cat to eat the many birds. What would have been his later\nsteps? It would almost be worth while to complete the experiment. It\nmight be done if there were only a sufficient cause. Men sneered at\nvivisection, and yet look at its results to-day! Why not advance science\nin its most difficult and vital aspect--the knowledge of the brain? Had\nI even the secret of one such mind--did I hold the key to the fancy of\neven one lunatic--I might advance my own branch of science to a pitch\ncompared with which Burdon-Sanderson's physiology or Ferrier's\nbrain-knowledge would be as nothing. If only there were a sufficient\ncause! I must not think too much of this, or I may be tempted; a good\ncause might turn the scale with me, for may not I too be of an\nexceptional brain, congenitally?\n\nHow well the man reasoned; lunatics always do within their own scope. I\nwonder at how many lives he values a man, or if at only one. He has\nclosed the account most accurately, and to-day begun a new record. How\nmany of us begin a new record with each day of our lives?\n\nTo me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope,\nand that truly I began a new record. So it will be until the Great\nRecorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to\nprofit or loss. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, I cannot be angry with you, nor can I be\nangry with my friend whose happiness is yours; but I must only wait on\nhopeless and work. Work! work!\n\nIf I only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there--a\ngood, unselfish cause to make me work--that would be indeed happiness.\n\n\n_Mina Murray's Journal._\n\n_26 July._--I am anxious, and it soothes me to express myself here; it\nis like whispering to one's self and listening at the same time. And\nthere is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it\ndifferent from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I\nhad not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but\nyesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so kind, sent me a letter from\nhim. I had written asking him if he had heard, and he said the enclosed\nhad just been received. It is only a line dated from Castle Dracula,\nand says that he is just starting for home. That is not like Jonathan;\nI do not understand it, and it makes me uneasy. Then, too, Lucy,\nalthough she is so well, has lately taken to her old habit of walking in\nher sleep. Her mother has spoken to me about it, and we have decided\nthat I am to lock the door of our room every night. Mrs. Westenra has\ngot an idea that sleep-walkers always go out on roofs of houses and\nalong the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over\nwith a despairing cry that echoes all over the place. Poor dear, she is\nnaturally anxious about Lucy, and she tells me that her husband, Lucy's\nfather, had the same habit; that he would get up in the night and dress\nhimself and go out, if he were not stopped. Lucy is to be married in the\nautumn, and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is\nto be arranged. I sympathise with her, for I do the same, only Jonathan\nand I will start in life in a very simple way, and shall have to try to\nmake both ends meet. Mr. Holmwood--he is the Hon. Arthur Holmwood, only\nson of Lord Godalming--is coming up here very shortly--as soon as he can\nleave town, for his father is not very well, and I think dear Lucy is\ncounting the moments till he comes. She wants to take him up to the seat\non the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of Whitby. I daresay it\nis the waiting which disturbs her; she will be all right when he\narrives.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_27 July._--No news from Jonathan. I am getting quite uneasy about him,\nthough why I should I do not know; but I do wish that he would write, if\nit were only a single line. Lucy walks more than ever, and each night I\nam awakened by her moving about the room. Fortunately, the weather is so\nhot that she cannot get cold; but still the anxiety and the perpetually\nbeing wakened is beginning to tell on me, and I am getting nervous and\nwakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy's health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been\nsuddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously\nill. Lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him, but it does not touch\nher looks; she is a trifle stouter, and her cheeks are a lovely\nrose-pink. She has lost that an\u00e6mic look which she had. I pray it will\nall last.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_3 August._--Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to\nMr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill. He\nsurely would have written. I look at that last letter of his, but\nsomehow it does not satisfy me. It does not read like him, and yet it is\nhis writing. There is no mistake of that. Lucy has not walked much in\nher sleep the last week, but there is an odd concentration about her\nwhich I do not understand; even in her sleep she seems to be watching\nme. She tries the door, and finding it locked, goes about the room\nsearching for the key.\n\n_6 August._--Another three days, and no news. This suspense is getting\ndreadful. If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should\nfeel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last\nletter. I must only pray to God for patience. Lucy is more excitable\nthan ever, but is otherwise well. Last night was very threatening, and\nthe fishermen say that we are in for a storm. I must try to watch it and\nlearn the weather signs. To-day is a grey day, and the sun as I write is\nhidden in thick clouds, high over Kettleness. Everything is grey--except\nthe green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it; grey earthy rock;\ngrey clouds, tinged with the sunburst at the far edge, hang over the\ngrey sea, into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers. The sea\nis tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar,\nmuffled in the sea-mists drifting inland. The horizon is lost in a grey\nmist. All is vastness; the clouds are piled up like giant rocks, and\nthere is a \"brool\" over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom.\nDark figures are on the beach here and there, sometimes half shrouded in\nthe mist, and seem \"men like trees walking.\" The fishing-boats are\nracing for home, and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into\nthe harbour, bending to the scuppers. Here comes old Mr. Swales. He is\nmaking straight for me, and I can see, by the way he lifts his hat, that\nhe wants to talk....\n\nI have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man. When he sat\ndown beside me, he said in a very gentle way:--\n\n\"I want to say something to you, miss.\" I could see he was not at ease,\nso I took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak\nfully; so he said, leaving his hand in mine:--\n\n\"I'm afraid, my deary, that I must have shocked you by all the wicked\nthings I've been sayin' about the dead, and such like, for weeks past;\nbut I didn't mean them, and I want ye to remember that when I'm gone. We\naud folks that be daffled, and with one foot abaft the krok-hooal, don't\naltogether like to think of it, and we don't want to feel scart of it;\nan' that's why I've took to makin' light of it, so that I'd cheer up my\nown heart a bit. But, Lord love ye, miss, I ain't afraid of dyin', not a\nbit; only I don't want to die if I can help it. My time must be nigh at\nhand now, for I be aud, and a hundred years is too much for any man to\nexpect; and I'm so nigh it that the Aud Man is already whettin' his\nscythe. Ye see, I can't get out o' the habit of caffin' about it all at\nonce; the chafts will wag as they be used to. Some day soon the Angel of\nDeath will sound his trumpet for me. But don't ye dooal an' greet, my\ndeary!\"--for he saw that I was crying--\"if he should come this very\nnight I'd not refuse to answer his call. For life be, after all, only a\nwaitin' for somethin' else than what we're doin'; and death be all that\nwe can rightly depend on. But I'm content, for it's comin' to me, my\ndeary, and comin' quick. It may be comin' while we be lookin' and\nwonderin'. Maybe it's in that wind out over the sea that's bringin' with\nit loss and wreck, and sore distress, and sad hearts. Look! look!\" he\ncried suddenly. \"There's something in that wind and in the hoast beyont\nthat sounds, and looks, and tastes, and smells like death. It's in the\nair; I feel it comin'. Lord, make me answer cheerful when my call\ncomes!\" He held up his arms devoutly, and raised his hat. His mouth\nmoved as though he were praying. After a few minutes' silence, he got\nup, shook hands with me, and blessed me, and said good-bye, and hobbled\noff. It all touched me, and upset me very much.\n\nI was glad when the coastguard came along, with his spy-glass under his\narm. He stopped to talk with me, as he always does, but all the time\nkept looking at a strange ship.\n\n\"I can't make her out,\" he said; \"she's a Russian, by the look of her;\nbut she's knocking about in the queerest way. She doesn't know her mind\na bit; she seems to see the storm coming, but can't decide whether to\nrun up north in the open, or to put in here. Look there again! She is\nsteered mighty strangely, for she doesn't mind the hand on the wheel;\nchanges about with every puff of wind. We'll hear more of her before\nthis time to-morrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nCUTTING FROM \"THE DAILYGRAPH,\" 8 AUGUST\n\n\n(_Pasted in Mina Murray's Journal._)\n\nFrom a Correspondent.\n\n_Whitby_.\n\nOne of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been\nexperienced here, with results both strange and unique. The weather had\nbeen somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of\nAugust. Saturday evening was as fine as was ever known, and the great\nbody of holiday-makers laid out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,\nRobin Hood's Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips in\nthe neighbourhood of Whitby. The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_ made\ntrips up and down the coast, and there was an unusual amount of\n\"tripping\" both to and from Whitby. The day was unusually fine till the\nafternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff\nchurchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of\nsea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show of\n\"mares'-tails\" high in the sky to the north-west. The wind was then\nblowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical\nlanguage is ranked \"No. 2: light breeze.\" The coastguard on duty at once\nmade report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century has\nkept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an emphatic\nmanner the coming of a sudden storm. The approach of sunset was so very\nbeautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds, that\nthere was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old\nchurchyard to enjoy the beauty. Before the sun dipped below the black\nmass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its\ndownward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,\npurple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here and\nthere masses not large, but of seemingly absolute blackness, in all\nsorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes. The\nexperience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the\nsketches of the \"Prelude to the Great Storm\" will grace the R. A. and R.\nI. walls in May next. More than one captain made up his mind then and\nthere that his \"cobble\" or his \"mule,\" as they term the different\nclasses of boats, would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed.\nThe wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there\nwas a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on\nthe approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature. There\nwere but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,\nwhich usually \"hug\" the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but\nfew fishing-boats were in sight. The only sail noticeable was a foreign\nschooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards. The\nfoolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for\ncomment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal\nher to reduce sail in face of her danger. Before the night shut down she\nwas seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating\nswell of the sea,\n\n    \"As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.\"\n\nShortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite\noppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep\ninland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and the\nband on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord in the\ngreat harmony of nature's silence. A little after midnight came a\nstrange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to\ncarry a strange, faint, hollow booming.\n\nThen without warning the tempest broke. With a rapidity which, at the\ntime, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realize,\nthe whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed. The waves rose in\ngrowing fury, each overtopping its fellow, till in a very few minutes\nthe lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.\nWhite-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the\nshelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume swept\nthe lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier\nof Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such\nforce that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet,\nor clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary\nto clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the\nfatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to\nthe difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came\ndrifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion,\nso dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of\nimagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were\ntouching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and many\na one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by. At times the mist\ncleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the\nlightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such sudden peals\nof thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock\nof the footsteps of the storm.\n\nSome of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of\nabsorbing interest--the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with\neach wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to\nsnatch at and whirl away into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with\na rag of sail, running madly for shelter before the blast; now and again\nthe white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird. On the summit of the East\nCliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been\ntried. The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in\nthe pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.\nOnce or twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat,\nwith gunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance\nof the sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the\npiers. As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of\njoy from the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed\nto cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.\n\nBefore long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner\nwith all sails set, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed\nearlier in the evening. The wind had by this time backed to the east,\nand there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they\nrealized the terrible danger in which she now was. Between her and the\nport lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time\nto time suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,\nit would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the\nharbour. It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so\ngreat that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost\nvisible, and the schooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such\nspeed that, in the words of one old salt, \"she must fetch up somewhere,\nif it was only in hell.\" Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than\nany hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things\nlike a grey pall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing,\nfor the roar of the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the\nbooming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder\nthan before. The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour\nmouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited\nbreathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant\nof the sea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between\nthe piers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed,\nswept the strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and\ngained the safety of the harbour. The searchlight followed her, and a\nshudder ran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a\ncorpse, with drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each\nmotion of the ship. No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great\nawe came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had\nfound the harbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man! However,\nall took place more quickly than it takes to write these words. The\nschooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on\nthat accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many\nstorms into the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East\nCliff, known locally as Tate Hill Pier.\n\nThere was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on\nthe sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of the\n\"top-hammer\" came crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant\nthe shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from below, as\nif shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow\non the sand. Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard\nhangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some of the flat\ntombstones--\"thruff-steans\" or \"through-stones,\" as they call them in\nthe Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the sustaining cliff\nhas fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which seemed\nintensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.\n\nIt so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as\nall those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were\nout on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern\nside of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier, was the\nfirst to climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after scouring\nthe entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then turned the\nlight on the derelict and kept it there. The coastguard ran aft, and\nwhen he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it, and recoiled at\nonce as though under some sudden emotion. This seemed to pique general\ncuriosity, and quite a number of people began to run. It is a good way\nround from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate Hill Pier, but your\ncorrespondent is a fairly good runner, and came well ahead of the crowd.\nWhen I arrived, however, I found already assembled on the pier a crowd,\nwhom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board. By the\ncourtesy of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted\nto climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman\nwhilst actually lashed to the wheel.\n\nIt was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for\nnot often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened\nby his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between\nthe inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it\nwas fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by\nthe binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but\nthe flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of\nthe wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he\nwas tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the\nstate of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of 33, East Elliot\nPlace--who came immediately after me, declared, after making\nexamination, that the man must have been dead for quite two days. In his\npocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a little roll of\npaper, which proved to be the addendum to the log. The coastguard said\nthe man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the knots with his\nteeth. The fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some\ncomplications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for coastguards cannot\nclaim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a\nderelict. Already, however, the legal tongues are wagging, and one young\nlaw student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already\ncompletely sacrificed, his property being held in contravention of the\nstatutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as emblemship, if not proof, of\ndelegated possession, is held in a _dead hand_. It is needless to say\nthat the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where\nhe held his honourable watch and ward till death--a steadfastness as\nnoble as that of the young Casabianca--and placed in the mortuary to\nawait inquest.\n\nAlready the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating;\ncrowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over\nthe Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further\ndetails of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into\nharbour in the storm.\n\n_Whitby_\n\n_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the\nstorm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself. It\nturns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called the\n_Demeter_. She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with only a\nsmall amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould.\nThis cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr. S. F. Billington, of\n7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and formally took\npossession of the goods consigned to him. The Russian consul, too,\nacting for the charter-party, took formal possession of the ship, and\npaid all harbour dues, etc. Nothing is talked about here to-day except\nthe strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of Trade have been\nmost exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with\nexisting regulations. As the matter is to be a \"nine days' wonder,\" they\nare evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after\ncomplaint. A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which\nlanded when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members of the\nS. P. C. A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend the\nanimal. To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be found;\nit seems to have disappeared entirely from the town. It may be that it\nwas frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is still\nhiding in terror. There are some who look with dread on such a\npossibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it\nis evidently a fierce brute. Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred\nmastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found\ndead in the roadway opposite to its master's yard. It had been fighting,\nand manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,\nand its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been\npermitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order\nup to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest\nexcept as to facts of missing men. The greatest interest, however, is\nwith regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced\nat the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them\nunfold it has not been my lot to come across. As there is no motive for\nconcealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send you a\nrescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and\nsupercargo. It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with\nsome kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that\nthis had developed persistently throughout the voyage. Of course my\nstatement must be taken _cum grano_, since I am writing from the\ndictation of a clerk of the Russian consul, who kindly translated for\nme, time being short.\n\n                         LOG OF THE \"DEMETER.\"\n\n\n_Varna to Whitby._\n\n_Written 18 July, things so strange happening, that I shall keep\naccurate note henceforth till we land._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn 6 July we finished taking in cargo, silver sand and boxes of earth.\nAt noon set sail. East wind, fresh. Crew, five hands ... two mates,\ncook, and myself (captain).\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn 11 July at dawn entered Bosphorus. Boarded by Turkish Customs\nofficers. Backsheesh. All correct. Under way at 4 p. m.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn 12 July through Dardanelles. More Customs officers and flagboat of\nguarding squadron. Backsheesh again. Work of officers thorough, but\nquick. Want us off soon. At dark passed into Archipelago.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn 13 July passed Cape Matapan. Crew dissatisfied about something.\nSeemed scared, but would not speak out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew. Men all steady fellows, who\nsailed with me before. Mate could not make out what was wrong; they only\ntold him there was _something_, and crossed themselves. Mate lost temper\nwith one of them that day and struck him. Expected fierce quarrel, but\nall was quiet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn 16 July mate reported in the morning that one of crew, Petrofsky, was\nmissing. Could not account for it. Took larboard watch eight bells last\nnight; was relieved by Abramoff, but did not go to bunk. Men more\ndowncast than ever. All said they expected something of the kind, but\nwould not say more than there was _something_ aboard. Mate getting very\nimpatient with them; feared some trouble ahead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn 17 July, yesterday, one of the men, Olgaren, came to my cabin, and in\nan awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man\naboard the ship. He said that in his watch he had been sheltering\nbehind the deck-house, as there was a rain-storm, when he saw a tall,\nthin man, who was not like any of the crew, come up the companion-way,\nand go along the deck forward, and disappear. He followed cautiously,\nbut when he got to bows found no one, and the hatchways were all closed.\nHe was in a panic of superstitious fear, and I am afraid the panic may\nspread. To allay it, I shall to-day search entire ship carefully from\nstem to stern.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater in the day I got together the whole crew, and told them, as they\nevidently thought there was some one in the ship, we would search from\nstem to stern. First mate angry; said it was folly, and to yield to such\nfoolish ideas would demoralise the men; said he would engage to keep\nthem out of trouble with a handspike. I let him take the helm, while the\nrest began thorough search, all keeping abreast, with lanterns: we left\nno corner unsearched. As there were only the big wooden boxes, there\nwere no odd corners where a man could hide. Men much relieved when\nsearch over, and went back to work cheerfully. First mate scowled, but\nsaid nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_22 July_.--Rough weather last three days, and all hands busy with\nsails--no time to be frightened. Men seem to have forgotten their dread.\nMate cheerful again, and all on good terms. Praised men for work in bad\nweather. Passed Gibralter and out through Straits. All well.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_24 July_.--There seems some doom over this ship. Already a hand short,\nand entering on the Bay of Biscay with wild weather ahead, and yet last\nnight another man lost--disappeared. Like the first, he came off his\nwatch and was not seen again. Men all in a panic of fear; sent a round\nrobin, asking to have double watch, as they fear to be alone. Mate\nangry. Fear there will be some trouble, as either he or the men will do\nsome violence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_28 July_.--Four days in hell, knocking about in a sort of maelstrom,\nand the wind a tempest. No sleep for any one. Men all worn out. Hardly\nknow how to set a watch, since no one fit to go on. Second mate\nvolunteered to steer and watch, and let men snatch a few hours' sleep.\nWind abating; seas still terrific, but feel them less, as ship is\nsteadier.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_29 July_.--Another tragedy. Had single watch to-night, as crew too\ntired to double. When morning watch came on deck could find no one\nexcept steersman. Raised outcry, and all came on deck. Thorough search,\nbut no one found. Are now without second mate, and crew in a panic. Mate\nand I agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_30 July_.--Last night. Rejoiced we are nearing England. Weather fine,\nall sails set. Retired worn out; slept soundly; awaked by mate telling\nme that both man of watch and steersman missing. Only self and mate and\ntwo hands left to work ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_1 August_.--Two days of fog, and not a sail sighted. Had hoped when in\nthe English Channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere.\nNot having power to work sails, have to run before wind. Dare not lower,\nas could not raise them again. We seem to be drifting to some terrible\ndoom. Mate now more demoralised than either of men. His stronger nature\nseems to have worked inwardly against himself. Men are beyond fear,\nworking stolidly and patiently, with minds made up to worst. They are\nRussian, he Roumanian.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_2 August, midnight_.--Woke up from few minutes' sleep by hearing a cry,\nseemingly outside my port. Could see nothing in fog. Rushed on deck, and\nran against mate. Tells me heard cry and ran, but no sign of man on\nwatch. One more gone. Lord, help us! Mate says we must be past Straits\nof Dover, as in a moment of fog lifting he saw North Foreland, just as\nhe heard the man cry out. If so we are now off in the North Sea, and\nonly God can guide us in the fog, which seems to move with us; and God\nseems to have deserted us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_3 August_.--At midnight I went to relieve the man at the wheel, and\nwhen I got to it found no one there. The wind was steady, and as we ran\nbefore it there was no yawing. I dared not leave it, so shouted for the\nmate. After a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels. He\nlooked wild-eyed and haggard, and I greatly fear his reason has given\nway. He came close to me and whispered hoarsely, with his mouth to my\near, as though fearing the very air might hear: \"_It_ is here; I know\nit, now. On the watch last night I saw It, like a man, tall and thin,\nand ghastly pale. It was in the bows, and looking out. I crept behind\nIt, and gave It my knife; but the knife went through It, empty as the\nair.\" And as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into\nspace. Then he went on: \"But It is here, and I'll find It. It is in the\nhold, perhaps in one of those boxes. I'll unscrew them one by one and\nsee. You work the helm.\" And, with a warning look and his finger on his\nlip, he went below. There was springing up a choppy wind, and I could\nnot leave the helm. I saw him come out on deck again with a tool-chest\nand a lantern, and go down the forward hatchway. He is mad, stark,\nraving mad, and it's no use my trying to stop him. He can't hurt those\nbig boxes: they are invoiced as \"clay,\" and to pull them about is as\nharmless a thing as he can do. So here I stay, and mind the helm, and\nwrite these notes. I can only trust in God and wait till the fog clears.\nThen, if I can't steer to any harbour with the wind that is, I shall cut\ndown sails and lie by, and signal for help....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate\nwould come out calmer--for I heard him knocking away at something in the\nhold, and work is good for him--there came up the hatchway a sudden,\nstartled scream, which made my blood run cold, and up on the deck he\ncame as if shot from a gun--a raging madman, with his eyes rolling and\nhis face convulsed with fear. \"Save me! save me!\" he cried, and then\nlooked round on the blanket of fog. His horror turned to despair, and in\na steady voice he said: \"You had better come too, captain, before it is\ntoo late. _He_ is there. I know the secret now. The sea will save me\nfrom Him, and it is all that is left!\" Before I could say a word, or\nmove forward to seize him, he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately\nthrew himself into the sea. I suppose I know the secret too, now. It was\nthis madman who had got rid of the men one by one, and now he has\nfollowed them himself. God help me! How am I to account for all these\nhorrors when I get to port? _When_ I get to port! Will that ever be?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_4 August._--Still fog, which the sunrise cannot pierce. I know there is\nsunrise because I am a sailor, why else I know not. I dared not go\nbelow, I dared not leave the helm; so here all night I stayed, and in\nthe dimness of the night I saw It--Him! God forgive me, but the mate was\nright to jump overboard. It was better to die like a man; to die like a\nsailor in blue water no man can object. But I am captain, and I must not\nleave my ship. But I shall baffle this fiend or monster, for I shall tie\nmy hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail, and along with\nthem I shall tie that which He--It!--dare not touch; and then, come good\nwind or foul, I shall save my soul, and my honour as a captain. I am\ngrowing weaker, and the night is coming on. If He can look me in the\nface again, I may not have time to act.... If we are wrecked, mayhap\nthis bottle may be found, and those who find it may understand; if not,\n... well, then all men shall know that I have been true to my trust. God\nand the Blessed Virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying\nto do his duty....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOf course the verdict was an open one. There is no evidence to adduce;\nand whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now\nnone to say. The folk here hold almost universally that the captain is\nsimply a hero, and he is to be given a public funeral. Already it is\narranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the Esk\nfor a piece and then brought back to Tate Hill Pier and up the abbey\nsteps; for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff. The owners\nof more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as\nwishing to follow him to the grave.\n\nNo trace has ever been found of the great dog; at which there is much\nmourning, for, with public opinion in its present state, he would, I\nbelieve, be adopted by the town. To-morrow will see the funeral; and so\nwill end this one more \"mystery of the sea.\"\n\n\n_Mina Murray's Journal._\n\n_8 August._--Lucy was very restless all night, and I, too, could not\nsleep. The storm was fearful, and as it boomed loudly among the\nchimney-pots, it made me shudder. When a sharp puff came it seemed to be\nlike a distant gun. Strangely enough, Lucy did not wake; but she got up\ntwice and dressed herself. Fortunately, each time I awoke in time and\nmanaged to undress her without waking her, and got her back to bed. It\nis a very strange thing, this sleep-walking, for as soon as her will is\nthwarted in any physical way, her intention, if there be any,\ndisappears, and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her\nlife.\n\nEarly in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see\nif anything had happened in the night. There were very few people about,\nand though the sun was bright, and the air clear and fresh, the big,\ngrim-looking waves, that seemed dark themselves because the foam that\ntopped them was like snow, forced themselves in through the narrow mouth\nof the harbour--like a bullying man going through a crowd. Somehow I\nfelt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night, but on land. But,\noh, is he on land or sea? Where is he, and how? I am getting fearfully\nanxious about him. If I only knew what to do, and could do anything!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_10 August._--The funeral of the poor sea-captain to-day was most\ntouching. Every boat in the harbour seemed to be there, and the coffin\nwas carried by captains all the way from Tate Hill Pier up to the\nchurchyard. Lucy came with me, and we went early to our old seat, whilst\nthe cort\u00e8ge of boats went up the river to the Viaduct and came down\nagain. We had a lovely view, and saw the procession nearly all the way.\nThe poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on\nit when the time came and saw everything. Poor Lucy seemed much upset.\nShe was restless and uneasy all the time, and I cannot but think that\nher dreaming at night is telling on her. She is quite odd in one thing:\nshe will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness; or if\nthere be, she does not understand it herself. There is an additional\ncause in that poor old Mr. Swales was found dead this morning on our\nseat, his neck being broken. He had evidently, as the doctor said,\nfallen back in the seat in some sort of fright, for there was a look of\nfear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder. Poor\ndear old man! Perhaps he had seen Death with his dying eyes! Lucy is so\nsweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other\npeople do. Just now she was quite upset by a little thing which I did\nnot much heed, though I am myself very fond of animals. One of the men\nwho came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog.\nThe dog is always with him. They are both quiet persons, and I never saw\nthe man angry, nor heard the dog bark. During the service the dog would\nnot come to its master, who was on the seat with us, but kept a few\nyards off, barking and howling. Its master spoke to it gently, and then\nharshly, and then angrily; but it would neither come nor cease to make a\nnoise. It was in a sort of fury, with its eyes savage, and all its hairs\nbristling out like a cat's tail when puss is on the war-path. Finally\nthe man, too, got angry, and jumped down and kicked the dog, and then\ntook it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on\nthe tombstone on which the seat is fixed. The moment it touched the\nstone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble. It did\nnot try to get away, but crouched down, quivering and cowering, and was\nin such a pitiable state of terror that I tried, though without effect,\nto comfort it. Lucy was full of pity, too, but she did not attempt to\ntouch the dog, but looked at it in an agonised sort of way. I greatly\nfear that she is of too super-sensitive a nature to go through the world\nwithout trouble. She will be dreaming of this to-night, I am sure. The\nwhole agglomeration of things--the ship steered into port by a dead\nman; his attitude, tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads; the\ntouching funeral; the dog, now furious and now in terror--will all\nafford material for her dreams.\n\nI think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically, so I\nshall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to Robin Hood's Bay and\nback. She ought not to have much inclination for sleep-walking then.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMINA MURRAY'S JOURNAL\n\n\n_Same day, 11 o'clock p. m._--Oh, but I am tired! If it were not that I\nhad made my diary a duty I should not open it to-night. We had a lovely\nwalk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some\ndear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse,\nand frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything\nexcept, of course, personal fear, and it seemed to wipe the slate clean\nand give us a fresh start.
