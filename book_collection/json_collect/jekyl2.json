The creature who crept into my house that\nnight was, on Jekyll\u2122s own confession, known by the name of Hyde and\nhunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.\n\nHASTIE LANYON.\n\n\n\n\nHENRY JEKYLL\u2122S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nI was born in the year 18\u201d to a large fortune, endowed besides with\nexcellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of\nthe wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been\nsupposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished\nfuture. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient\ngaiety of disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such\nas I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my\nhead high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the\npublic. Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that\nwhen I reached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take\nstock of my progress and position in the world, I stood already\ncommitted to a profound duplicity of life. Many a man would have even\nblazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high\nviews that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost\nmorbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my\naspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me\nwhat I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men,\nsevered in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound\nman\u2122s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and\ninveterately on that hard law of life, which lies at the root of\nreligion and is one of the most plentiful springs of distress. Though\nso profound a double-dealer, I was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides\nof me were in dead earnest; I was no more myself when I laid aside\nrestraint and plunged in shame, than when I laboured, in the eye of\nday, at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and\nsuffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies,\nwhich led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and\nshed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my\nmembers. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the\nmoral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth,\nby whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful\nshipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because\nthe state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others\nwill follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard\nthe guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of\nmultifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part,\nfrom the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in\none direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person,\nthat I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man;\nI saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my\nconsciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was\nonly because I was radically both; and from an early date, even before\nthe course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most\nnaked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with\npleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of\nthese elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate\nidentities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the\nunjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of\nhis more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely\non his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his\npleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands\nof this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these\nincongruous faggots were thus bound together\u201dthat in the agonised womb\nof consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling.\nHow, then were they dissociated?\n\nI was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began\nto shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to\nperceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling\nimmateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body\nin which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to\nshake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss\nthe curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter\ndeeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I\nhave been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound\nfor ever on man\u2122s shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast it\noff, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful\npressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too\nevident, my discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only\nrecognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain\nof the powers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by\nwhich these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a\nsecond form and countenance substituted, none the less natural to me\nbecause they were the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements\nin my soul.\n\nI hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I\nknew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled\nand shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of\nan overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition,\nutterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to\nchange. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at\nlast overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my\ntincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a\nlarge quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,\nto be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I\ncompounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the\nglass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of\ncourage, drank off the potion.\n\nThe most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly\nnausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour\nof birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I\ncame to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something\nstrange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its\nvery novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in\nbody; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of\ndisordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a\nsolution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent\nfreedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new\nlife, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my\noriginal evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me\nlike wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these\nsensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in\nstature.\n\nThere was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside\nme as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose of\nthese transformations. The night however, was far gone into the\nmorning\u201dthe morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the\nconception of the day\u201dthe inmates of my house were locked in the most\nrigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope\nand triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I\ncrossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I\ncould have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that\ntheir unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through\nthe corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw\nfor the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.\n\nI must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but\nthat which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature,\nto which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust\nand less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in\nthe course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of\neffort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much\nless exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde\nwas so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as\ngood shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly\nand plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still\nbelieve to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint\nof deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in\nthe glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of\nwelcome. This, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes\nit bore a livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and\nsingle, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto\naccustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have\nobserved that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come\nnear to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as\nI take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are\ncommingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of\nmankind, was pure evil.\n\nI lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive\nexperiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had\nlost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a\nhouse that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once\nmore prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of\ndissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the\nstature and the face of Henry Jekyll.\n\nThat night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my\ndiscovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while\nunder the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been\notherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth\nan angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action; it\nwas neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the\nprisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that\nwhich stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my\nevil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the\noccasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence,\nalthough I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was\nwholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that\nincongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already\nlearned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.\n\nEven at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a\nlife of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my\npleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well\nknown and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this\nincoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this\nside that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to\ndrink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to\nassume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the\nnotion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my\npreparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that\nhouse in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as\na housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and\nunscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr.\nHyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my\nhouse in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made\nmyself a familiar object, in my second character. I next drew up that\nwill to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in\nthe person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without\npecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I\nbegan to profit by the strange immunities of my position.\n\nMen have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own\nperson and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did\nso for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye\nwith a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a\nschoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of\nliberty. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was\ncomplete. Think of it\u201dI did not even exist! Let me but escape into my\nlaboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the\ndraught that I had always standing ready; and whatever he had done,\nEdward Hyde would pass away like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and\nthere in his stead, quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his\nstudy, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry\nJekyll.\n\nThe pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have\nsaid, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands\nof Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I\nwould come back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind\nof wonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of\nmy own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being\ninherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on\nself; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture\nto another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times\naghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from\nordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was\nHyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse;\nhe woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even\nmake haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And\nthus his conscience slumbered.\n\nInto the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now I\ncan scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I\nmean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which\nmy chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it\nbrought on no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of\ncruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I\nrecognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and\nthe child\u2122s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my\nlife; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward\nHyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in\nthe name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from\nthe future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward\nHyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied\nmy double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.\n\nSome two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for\none of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next\nday in bed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about\nme; in vain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room\nin the square; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed\ncurtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept\ninsisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I\nseemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to\nsleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my\npsychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this\nillusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a\ncomfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my\nmore wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand. Now the hand of Henry\nJekyll (as you have often remarked) was professional in shape and size;\nit was large, firm, white and comely. But the hand which I now saw,\nclearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half\nshut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor\nand thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair. It was the hand of\nEdward Hyde.\n\nI must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the\nmere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden\nand startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I\nrushed to the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was\nchanged into something exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed\nHenry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained?\nI asked myself; and then, with another bound of terror\u201dhow was it to be\nremedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my\ndrugs were in the cabinet\u201da long journey down two pairs of stairs,\nthrough the back passage, across the open court and through the\nanatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It\nmight indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,\nwhen I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then\nwith an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind\nthat the servants were already used to the coming and going of my\nsecond self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of\nmy own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared\nand drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange\narray; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape\nand was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of\nbreakfasting.\n\nSmall indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal\nof my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the\nwall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to\nreflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities\nof my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of\nprojecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed\nto me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature,\nas though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous\ntide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much\nprolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown,\nthe power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward\nHyde become irrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always\nequally displayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed\nme; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double,\nand once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these\nrare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.\nNow, however, and in the light of that morning\u2122s accident, I was led to\nremark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw\noff the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly\ntransferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to\npoint to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better\nself, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.\n\nBetween these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had\nmemory in common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared\nbetween them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive\napprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the\npleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll,\nor but remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in\nwhich he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father\u2122s\ninterest; Hyde had more than a son\u2122s indifference. To cast in my lot\nwith Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly\nindulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was\nto die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a\nblow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear\nunequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for\nwhile Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde\nwould be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my\ncircumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace\nas man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any\ntempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with\nso vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was\nfound wanting in the strength to keep to it.\n\nYes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by\nfriends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to\nthe liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses\nand secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I\nmade this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I\nneither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward\nHyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I\nwas true to my determination; for two months, I led a life of such\nseverity as I had never before attained to, and enjoyed the\ncompensations of an approving conscience. But time began at last to\nobliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began\nto grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and\nlongings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour\nof moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the\ntransforming draught.\n\nI do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his\nvice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that\nhe runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,\nlong as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the\ncomplete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which\nwere the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I\nwas punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was\nconscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more\nfurious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that\nstirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to\nthe civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God,\nno man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so\npitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit\nthan that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had\nvoluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which\neven the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness\namong temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was\nto fall.\n\nInstantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of\nglee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;\nand it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was\nsuddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a\ncold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit;\nand fled from the scene of these excesses, at once glorying and\ntrembling, my lust of evil gratified and stimulated, my love of life\nscrewed to the topmost peg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make\nassurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence I set out through\nthe lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on\nmy crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still\nhastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger.\nHyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he\ndrank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not\ndone tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of\ngratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped\nhands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I\nsaw my life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood,\nwhen I had walked with my father\u2122s hand, and through the self-denying\ntoils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same\nsense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could have\nscreamed aloud; I sought with tears and prayers to smother down the\ncrowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memory swarmed against\nme; and still, between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniquity\nstared into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die\naway, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was\nsolved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was\nnow confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced\nto think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the\nrestrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked\nthe door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key\nunder my heel!\n\nThe next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked,\nthat the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was\na man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a\ntragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have\nmy better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the\nscaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an\ninstant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.\n\nI resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with\nhonesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself\nhow earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to\nrelieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the\ndays passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say\nthat I wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead\nthat I daily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my\nduality of purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the\nlower side of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to\ngrowl for licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare\nidea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person\nthat I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was\nas an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of\ntemptation.\n\nThere comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled\nat last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the\nbalance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural,\nlike a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a\nfine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted,\nbut cloudless overhead; and the Regent\u2122s Park was full of winter\nchirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench;\nthe animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a\nlittle drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to\nbegin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I\nsmiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will\nwith the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that\nvainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the\nmost deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then\nas in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in\nthe temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a\nsolution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung\nformlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was\ncorded and hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had\nbeen safe of all men\u2122s respect, wealthy, beloved\u201dthe cloth laying for\nme in the dining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of\nmankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.\n\nMy reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than\nonce observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed\nsharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came\nabout that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the\nimportance of the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my\ncabinet; how was I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing\nmy temples in my hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I\nhad closed. If I sought to enter by the house, my own servants would\nconsign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and\nthought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing\nthat I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into\nhis presence? and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor,\nprevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague,\nDr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that of my original character, one part\nremained to me: I could write my own hand; and once I had conceived\nthat kindling spark, the way that I must follow became lighted up from\nend to end.\n\nThereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a\npassing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which\nI chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical\nenough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could\nnot conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of\ndevilish fury; and the smile withered from his face\u201dhappily for him\u201dyet\nmore happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged\nhim from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so\nblack a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they\nexchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a\nprivate room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of\nhis life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung\nto the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was\nastute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his\ntwo important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he\nmight receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with\ndirections that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all\nday over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he\ndined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before\nhis eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the\ncorner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of\nthe city. He, I say\u201dI cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing\nhuman; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last,\nthinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab\nand ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object\nmarked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers,\nthese two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked\nfast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the\nless frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided\nhim from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box\nof lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.\n\nWhen I came to myself at Lanyon\u2122s, the horror of my old friend perhaps\naffected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in the\nsea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A\nchange had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it\nwas the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon\u2122s\ncondemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came\nhome to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration of\nthe day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the\nnightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning\nshaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought\nof the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten\nthe appalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home,\nin my own house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape\nshone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of\nhope.\n\nI was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking the\nchill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those\nindescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the\ntime to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging\nand freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a\ndouble dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat\nlooking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be\nre-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a\ngreat effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation\nof the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all\nhours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory\nshudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair,\nit was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this\ncontinually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now\ncondemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I\nbecame, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever,\nlanguidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one\nthought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the\nvirtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition\n(for the pangs of transformation grew daily less marked) into the\npossession of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling\nwith causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough to\ncontain the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have\ngrown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now\ndivided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of\nvital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature\nthat shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was\nco-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which\nin themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought\nof Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish\nbut inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit\nseemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated\nand sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the\noffices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to\nhim closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh,\nwhere he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every\nhour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against\nhim, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of\na different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to\ncommit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a\npart instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the\ndespondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the\ndislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks\nthat he would play me, scrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the\npages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of\nmy father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would\nlong ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But\nhis love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at\nthe mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of\nthis attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off\nby suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.\n\nIt is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this\ndescription; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice;\nand yet even to these, habit brought\u201dno, not alleviation\u201dbut a certain\ncallousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my\npunishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity\nwhich has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face\nand nature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed\nsince the date of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out\nfor a fresh supply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and\nthe first change of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was\nwithout efficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London\nransacked; it was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply\nwas impure, and that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy\nto the draught.\n\nAbout a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under\nthe influence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last\ntime, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts\nor see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I\ndelay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has\nhitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great\nprudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in\nthe act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time\nshall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness\nand circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from\nthe action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing\non us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now,\nwhen I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know\nhow I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with\nthe most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and\ndown this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of\nmenace. Will Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to\nrelease himself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is\nmy true hour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than\nmyself. Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my\nconfession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK\nTHE STRANGE CASE OF DR.
