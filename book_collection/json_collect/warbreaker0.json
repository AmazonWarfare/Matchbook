{"genre": ["Fantasy"], "text": ["It\u2019s funny, Vasher thought, how many things begin with my getting thrown into prison.\n\nThe guards laughed to one another, slamming the cell door shut with a clang. Vasher stood and dusted himself off, rolling his shoulder and wincing. While the bottom half of his cell door was solid wood, the top half was barred, and he could see the three guards open his large duffel and rifle through his possessions.\n\nOne of them noticed him watching. The guard was an oversized beast of a man with a shaved head and a dirty uniform that barely retained the bright yellow and blue coloring of the T\u2019Telir city guard.\n\nBright colors, Vasher thought. I\u2019ll have to get used to those again. In any other nation, the vibrant blues and yellows would have been ridiculous on soldiers. This, however, was Hallandren: land of Returned gods, Lifeless servants, BioChromatic research, and\u2014of course\u2014color.\n\nThe large guard sauntered up to the cell door, leaving his friends to amuse themselves with Vasher\u2019s belongings. \u201cThey say you\u2019re pretty tough,\u201d the man said, sizing up Vasher.\n\nVasher did not respond.\n\n\u201cThe bartender says you beat down some twenty men in the brawl.\u201d The guard rubbed his chin. \u201cYou don\u2019t look that tough to me. Either way, you should have known better than to strike a priest. The others, they\u2019ll spend a night locked up. You, though . . . you\u2019ll hang. Colorless fool.\u201d\n\nVasher turned away. His cell was functional, if unoriginal. A thin slit at the top of one wall let in light, the stone walls dripped with water and moss, and a pile of dirty straw decomposed in the corner.\n\n\u201cYou ignoring me?\u201d the guard asked, stepping closer to the door. The colors of his uniform brightened, as if he\u2019d stepped into a stronger light. The change was slight. Vasher didn\u2019t have much Breath remaining, and so his aura didn\u2019t do much to the colors around him. The guard didn\u2019t notice the change in color\u2014just as he hadn\u2019t noticed back in the bar, when he and his buddies had picked Vasher up off the floor and thrown him in their cart. Of course, the change was so slight to the unaided eye that it would have been nearly impossible to pick out.\n\n\u201cHere, now,\u201d said one of the men looking through Vasher\u2019s duffel. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Vasher had always found it interesting that the men who watched dungeons tended to be as bad as, or worse than, the men they guarded. Perhaps that was deliberate. Society didn\u2019t seem to care if such men were outside the cells or in them, so long as they were kept away from more honest men.\n\nAssuming that such a thing existed.\n\nFrom Vasher\u2019s bag, a guard pulled free a long object wrapped in white linen. The man whistled as he unwrapped the cloth, revealing a long, thin-bladed sword in a silver sheath. The hilt was pure black. \u201cWho do you suppose he stole this from?\u201d\n\nThe lead guard eyed Vasher, likely wondering if Vasher was some kind of nobleman. Though Hallandren had no aristocracy, many neighboring kingdoms had their lords and ladies. Yet what lord would wear a drab brown cloak, ripped in several places? What lord would sport bruises from a bar fight, a half-grown beard, and boots worn from years of walking? The guard turned away, apparently convinced that Vasher was no lord.\nHe was right. And he was wrong.\n\n\u201cLet me see that,\u201d the lead guard said, taking the sword. He grunted, obviously surprised by its weight. He turned it about, noting the clasp that tied sheath to hilt, keeping the blade from being drawn. He undid the clasp.\n\nThe colors in the room deepened. They didn\u2019t grow brighter\u2014not the way the guard\u2019s vest had when he approached Vasher. Instead, they grew stronger. Darker. Reds became maroon. Yellows hardened to gold. Blues approached navy.\n\n\u201cBe careful, friend,\u201d Vasher said softly, \u201cthat sword can be dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe guard looked up. All was still. Then the guard snorted and walked away from Vasher\u2019s cell, still carrying the sword. The other two followed, bearing Vasher\u2019s duffel, entering the guard room at the end of the hallway.\n\nThe door thumped shut. Vasher immediately knelt beside the patch of straw, selecting a handful of sturdy lengths. He pulled threads from his cloak\u2014it was beginning to fray at the bottom\u2014and tied the straw into the shape of a small person, perhaps three inches high, with bushy arms and legs. He plucked a hair from one of his eyebrows, set it against the straw figure\u2019s head, then reached into his boot and pulled out a brilliant red scarf.\n\nThen Vasher Breathed.\n\nIt flowed out of him, puffing into the air, translucent yet radiant, like the color of oil on water in the sun. Vasher felt it leave: BioChromatic Breath, scholars called it. Most people just called it Breath. Each person had one. Or, at least, that was how it usually went. One person, one Breath.\n\nVasher had around fifty Breaths, just enough to reach the First Heightening. Having so few made him feel poor compared with what he\u2019d once held, but many would consider fifty Breaths to be a great treasure. Unfortunately, even Awakening a small figure made from organic material\u2014using a piece of his own body as a focus\u2014drained away some half of his Breaths.\n\nThe little straw figure jerked, sucking in the Breath. In Vasher\u2019s hand, half of the brilliant red scarf faded to grey. Vasher leaned down\u2014imagining what he wanted the figure to do\u2014and completed the final step of the process as he gave the Command.\n\n\u201cFetch keys,\u201d he said.\n\nThe straw figure stood and raised its single eyebrow toward Vasher.\n\nVasher pointed toward the guard room. From it, he heard sudden shouts of surprise.\n\nNot much time, he thought.\n\nThe straw person ran along the floor, then jumped up, vaulting between the bars. Vasher pulled off his cloak and set it on the floor. It was the perfect shape of a person\u2014marked with rips that matched the scars on Vasher\u2019s body, its hood cut with holes to match Vasher\u2019s eyes. The closer an object was to human shape and form, the fewer Breaths it took to Awaken.\nVasher leaned down, trying not to think of the days when he\u2019d had enough Breaths to Awaken without regard for shape or focus. That had been a different time. Wincing, he pulled a tuft of hair from his head, then sprinkled it across the hood of the cloak.\n\nOnce again, he Breathed.\n\nIt took the rest of his Breath. With it gone\u2014the cloak trembling, the scarf losing the rest of its color\u2014 Vasher felt . . . dimmer. Losing one\u2019s Breath was not fatal. Indeed, the extra Breaths Vasher used had once belonged to other people. Vasher didn\u2019t know who they were; he hadn\u2019t gathered these Breaths himself. They had been given to him. But, of course, that was the way it was always supposed to work. One could not take Breath by force.\n\nBeing void of Breath did change him. Colors didn\u2019t seem as bright. He couldn\u2019t feel the bustling people moving about in the city above, a connection he normally took for granted. It was the awareness all men had for others\u2014that thing which whispered a warning, in the drowsiness of sleep, when someone entered the room. In Vasher, that sense had been magnified fifty times.\n\nAnd now it was gone. Sucked into the cloak and the straw person, giving them power.\n\nThe cloak jerked. Vasher leaned down. \u201cProtect me,\u201d he Commanded, and the cloak grew still. He stood, throwing it back on.\n\nThe straw figure returned to his window. It carried a large ring of keys. The figure\u2019s straw feet were stained red. The crimson blood seemed so dull to Vasher now.\n\nHe took the keys. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said. He always thanked them. He didn\u2019t know why, particularly considering what he did next. \u201cYour Breath to mine,\u201d he commanded, touching the straw person\u2019s chest. The straw person immediately fell backward off the door\u2014life draining from it\u2014and Vasher got his Breath back. The familiar sense of awareness returned, the knowledge of connectedness,\n\nof fitting. He could only take the Breath back because he\u2019d Awakened this creature himself\u2014indeed, Awakenings of this sort were rarely permanent. He used his Breath like a reserve, doling it out, then recovering it.\n\nCompared with what he had once held, twenty-five Breaths was a laughably small number. However, compared with nothing, it seemed infinite. He shivered in satisfaction.\n\nThe yells from the guard room died out. The dungeon fell still. He had to keep moving.\n\nVasher reached through the bars, using the keys to unlock his cell. He pushed the thick door open, rushing out into the hallway, leaving the straw figure discarded on the ground. He didn\u2019t walk to the guard room\u2014and the exit beyond it\u2014but instead turned south, penetrating deeper into the dungeon.\n\nThis was the most uncertain part of his plan. Finding a tavern that was frequented by priests of the Iridescent Tones had been easy enough. Getting into a bar fight\u2014then striking one of those same priests\u2014had been equally simple. Hallandren took their religious figures very seriously, and Vasher had earned himself not the usual imprisonment in a local jail, but a trip to the God King\u2019s dungeons.\n\nKnowing the kind of men who tended to guard such dungeons, he\u2019d had a pretty good idea that they would try to draw Nightblood. That had given him the diversion he\u2019d needed to get the keys.\nBut now came the unpredictable part.\n\nVasher stopped, Awakened cloak rustling. It was easy to locate the cell he wanted, for around it a large patch of stone had been drained of color, leaving both walls and doors a dull grey. It was a place to imprison an Awakener, for no color meant no Awakening. Vasher stepped up to the door, looking through the bars. A man hung by his arms from the ceiling, naked and chained. His color was vibrant to Vasher\u2019s eyes, his skin a pure tan, his bruises brilliant splashes of blue and violet.\n\nThe man was gagged. Another precaution. In order to Awaken, the man would need three things: Breath, color, and a Command. The harmonics and the hues, some called it. The Iridescent Tones, the relationship between color and sound. A Command had to be spoken clearly and firmly in the Awakener\u2019s native language\u2014any stuttering, any mispronunciation, would invalidate the Awakening. The Breath would be drawn out, but the object would be unable to act.\n\nVasher used the prison keys to unlock the cell door, then stepped inside. This man\u2019s aura made colors grow brighter by sharp measure when they got close to him. Anyone would be able to notice an aura that strong, though it was much easier for someone who had reached the First Heightening.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the strongest BioChromatic aura Vasher had ever seen\u2014those belonged to the Returned, known as gods here in Hallandren. Still, the prisoner\u2019s BioChroma was very impressive and much, much stronger than Vasher\u2019s own. The prisoner held a lot of Breaths. Hundreds upon hundreds of them.\n\nThe man swung in his bonds, studying Vasher, gagged lips bleeding from lack of water. Vasher hesitated only briefly, then reached up and pulled the gag free.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d the prisoner whispered, coughing slightly. \u201cAre you here to free me?\u201d \u201cNo, Vahr,\u201d Vasher said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m here to kill you.\u201d\n\nVahr snorted. Captivity hadn\u2019t been easy on him. When Vasher had last seen Vahr, he\u2019d been plump. Judging by his emaciated body, he\u2019d been without food for some time now. The cuts, bruises, and burn marks on his flesh were fresh.\n\nBoth the torture and the haunted look in Vahr\u2019s bag-rimmed eyes bespoke a solemn truth. Breath could only be transferred by willing, intentional Command. That Command could, however, be encouraged.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Vahr croaked, \u201cyou judge me, just like everyone else.\u201d \u201cYour failed rebellion is not my concern. I just want your Breath.\u201d \u201cYou and the entire Hallandren court.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. But you\u2019re not going to give it to one of the Returned. You\u2019re going to give it to me. In exchange for killing you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like much of a trade.\u201d There was a hardness\u2014a void of emotion\u2014in Vahr that Vasher had not seen the last time they had parted, years before.\n\nOdd, Vasher thought, that I should finally, after all of this time, find something in the man that I can identify with.\nVasher kept a wary distance from Vahr. Now that the man\u2019s voice was free, he could Command. However, he was touching nothing except for the metal chains, and metal was very difficult to Awaken. It had never been alive, and it was far from the form of a man. Even during the height of his power, Vasher himself had only managed to Awaken metal on a few select occasions. Of course, some extremely powerful Awakeners could bring objects to life that they weren\u2019t touching, but that were in the sound of their voice. That, however, required the Ninth Heightening. Even Vahr didn\u2019t\n\nhave that much Breath. In fact, Vasher knew of only one living person who did: the God King himself.\n\nThat meant Vasher was probably safe. Vahr contained a great wealth of Breath, but had nothing to Awaken. Vasher walked around the chained man, finding it very difficult to offer any sympathy. Vahr had earned his fate. Yet the priests would not let him die while he held so much Breath; if he died, it would be wasted. Gone. Irretrievable.\n\nNot even the government of Hallandren\u2014which had such strict laws about the buying and passing of Breath\u2014could let such a treasure slip away. They wanted it badly enough to forestall the execution of even a high-profile criminal like Vahr. In retrospect, they would curse themselves for not leaving him better guarded.\n\nBut, then, Vasher had been waiting two years for an opportunity like this one.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Vahr asked.\n\n\u201cGive me the Breath, Vahr,\u201d Vasher said, stepping forward.\n\nVahr snorted. \u201cI doubt you have the skill of the God King\u2019s torturers, Vasher\u2014and I\u2019ve withstood them for two weeks now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised. But that doesn\u2019t matter. You are going to give me your Breath. You know you have only two choices. Give it to me, or give it to them.\u201d\n\nVahr hung by his wrists, rotating slowly. Silent.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have much time to consider,\u201d Vasher said. \u201cAny moment now, someone is going to discover the dead guards outside. The alarm will be raised. I\u2019ll leave you, you will be tortured again, and\nyou will eventually break. Then all the power you\u2019ve gathered will go to the very people you vowed to destroy.\u201d\n\nVahr stared at the floor. Vasher let him hang for a few moments, and could see that the reality of the situation was clear to him. Finally, Vahr looked up atVasher. \u201cThat . . . thing you bear. It\u2019s here, in the city?\u201d\n\nVasher nodded.\n\n\u201cThe screams I heard earlier? It caused them?\u201d\n\nVasher nodded again.\n\n\u201cHow long will you be in T\u2019Telir?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a time. A year, perhaps.\u201d\n\u201cWill you use it against them?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy goals are my own to know, Vahr. Will you take my deal or not? Quick death in exchange for those Breaths. I promise you this. Your enemies will not have them.\u201d\n\nVahr grew quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d he finally whispered.\n\nVasher reached over, resting his hand on Vahr\u2019s forehead\u2014careful not to let any part of his clothing touch the man\u2019s skin, lest Vahr draw forth color for Awakening.\n\nVahr didn\u2019t move. He looked numb. Then, just as Vasher began to worry that the prisoner had changed his mind, Vahr Breathed. The color drained from him. The beautiful Iridescence, the aura that had made him look majestic despite his wounds and chains. It flowed from his mouth, hanging in the air, shimmering like mist. Vasher drew it in, closing his eyes.\n\n\u201cMy life to yours,\u201d Vahr Commanded, a hint of despair in his voice. \u201cMy Breath become yours.\u201d\n\nThe Breath flooded into Vasher, and everything became vibrant. His brown cloak now seemed deep and rich in color. The blood on the floor was intensely red, as if aflame. Even Vahr\u2019s skin seemed a masterpiece of color, the surface marked by deep black hairs, blue bruises, and sharp red cuts. It had been years since Vasher had felt such . . . life.\n\nHe gasped, falling to his knees as it overwhelmed him, and he had to drop a hand to the stone floor to keep himself from toppling over. How did I live without this?\n\nHe knew that his senses hadn\u2019t actually improved, yet he felt so much more alert. More aware of the beauty of sensation. When he touched the stone floor, he marveled at its roughness. And the sound of wind passing through the thin dungeon window up above. Had it always been that melodic? How could he not have noticed?\n\n\u201cKeep your part of the bargain,\u201d Vahr said. Vasher noted the tones in his voice, the beauty of each one, how close they were to harmonics. Vasher had gained perfect pitch. A gift for anyone who reached the Second Heightening. It would be good to have that again.\n\nVasher could, of course, have up to the Fifth Heightening at any time, if he wished. That would require certain sacrifices he wasn\u2019t willing to make. And so he forced himself to do it the old-fashioned way, by gathering Breaths from people like Vahr.\n\nVasher stood, then pulled out the colorless scarf he had used earlier. He tossed it over Vahr\u2019s shoulder, then Breathed.\n\nHe didn\u2019t bother making the scarf have human shape, didn\u2019t need to use a bit of his hair or skin for a focus\u2014though he did have to draw the color from his shirt.\n\nVasher met Vahr\u2019s resigned eyes.\n\n\u201cStrangle things,\u201d Vasher Commanded, fingers touching the quivering scarf.\n\nIt twisted immediately, pulling away a large\u2014yet now inconsequential\u2014amount of Breath. The scarf quickly wrapped around Vahr\u2019s neck, tightening, choking him. Vahr didn\u2019t struggle or gasp; he simply watched Vasher with hatred until his eyes bulged and he died.\nHatred. Vasher had known enough of that in his time. He quietly reached up and recovered his Breath from the scarf, then left Vahr dangling in his cell. Vasher passed quietly through the prison, marveling at the color of the woods and the stones. After a few moments of walking, he noticed a new color in the hallway. Red.\n\nHe stepped around the pool of blood\u2014which was seeping down the inclined dungeon floor\u2014and moved into the guard room. The three guards lay dead. One of them sat in a chair. Nightblood, still mostly sheathed, had been rammed through the man\u2019s chest. About an inch of a dark black blade was visible beneath the silver sheath.\n\nVasher carefully slid the weapon fully back into its sheath. He did up the clasp.\n\nI did very well today, a voice said in his mind.\n\nVasher didn\u2019t respond to the sword.\n\nI killed them all, Nightblood continued. Aren\u2019t you proud of me?\n\nVasher picked up the weapon, accustomed to its unusual weight, and carried it in one hand. He recovered his duffel and slung it over his shoulder.\n\nI knew you\u2019d be impressed, Nightblood said, sounding satisfied.\n\nThere were great advantages to being unimportant.\n\nTrue, by many people\u2019s standards, Siri wasn\u2019t \u201cunimportant.\u201d She was, after all, the daughter of a king. Fortunately, her father had four living children, and Siri\u2014at seventeen years of age\u2014was the youngest. Fafen, the daughter just older than Siri, had done the family duty and become a monk. Above Fafen was Ridger, the eldest son. He would inherit the throne.\n\nAnd then there was Vivenna. Siri sighed as she walked down the path back to the city. Vivenna, the firstborn, was . . . well . . . Vivenna. Beautiful, poised, perfect in most every way. It was a good thing, too, considering the fact that she was betrothed to a god. Either way, Siri\u2014as fourth child\u2014was redundant. Vivenna and Ridger had to focus on their studies; Fafen had to do her work in the pastures and homes. Siri, however, could get away with being unimportant. That meant she could disappear into the wilderness for hours at a time.\n\nPeople would notice, of course, and she would get into trouble. Yet even her father would have to admit that her disappearance hadn\u2019t caused much inconvenience. The city got along just fine without Siri\u2014in fact, it tended to do a little better when she wasn\u2019t around.\n\nUnimportance. To another, it might have been offensive. To Siri it was a blessing. She smiled, walking into the city proper. She drew the inevitable stares. While Bevalis was technically the capital of Idris, it wasn\u2019t that big, and everyone knew her by sight. Judging by the stories Siri had heard from passing ramblemen, her home was hardly even a village compared with the massive metropolises in other nations.\n\nShe liked it the way it was, even with the muddy streets, the thatched cottages, and the boring\u2014yet sturdy\u2014stone walls. Women chasing runaway geese, men pulling donkeys laden with spring seed, and children leading sheep on their way to pasture. A grand city in Xaka, Hudres, or even terrible\nHallandren might have exotic sights, but it would be crowded with faceless, shouting, jostling crowds, and haughty noblemen. Not Siri\u2019s preference; she generally found even Bevalis to be a bit busy for her.\n\nStill, she thought, looking down at her utilitarian grey dress, I\u2019ll bet those cities have more colors.\n\nThat\u2019s something I might like to see.\n\nHer hair wouldn\u2019t stand out so much there. As usual, the long locks had gone blond with joy while she\u2019d been out in the fields. She concentrated, trying to rein them in, but she was only able to bring the color to a dull brown. As soon as she stopped focusing, her hair just went back to the way it had been. She\u2019d never been very good at controlling it. Not like Vivenna.\n\nAs she continued through the town, a group of small figures began trailing her. She smiled, pretending to ignore the children until one of them was brave enough to run forward and tug on her dress. Then she turned, smiling. They regarded her with solemn faces. Idrian children were trained even at this age to avoid shameful outbursts of emotion. Austrin teachings said there was nothing wrong with feelings, but drawing attention to yourself with them was wrong.\n\nSiri had never been very devout. It wasn\u2019t her fault, she reasoned, if Austre had made her with a distinct inability to obey. The children waited patiently until Siri reached into her apron and pulled out a couple of brightly colored flowers. The children\u2019s eyes opened wide, gazing at the vibrant colors. Three of the flowers were blue, one yellow.\n\nThe flowers stood out starkly against the town\u2019s determined drabness. Other than what one could find in the skin and eyes of the people, there wasn\u2019t a drop of color in sight. Stones had been whitewashed, clothing bleached grey or tan. All to keep the color away.\n\nFor without color, there could be no Awakeners.\n\nThe girl who had tugged Siri\u2019s skirt finally took the flowers in one hand and dashed away with them, the other children following behind. Siri caught a look of disproval in the eyes of several passing villagers. None of them confronted her, though. Being a princess\u2014even an unimportant one\u2014did have its perks.\n\nShe continued on toward the palace. It was a low, single-story building with a large, packed-earth courtyard. Siri avoided the crowds of haggling people at the front, rounding to the back and going in the kitchen entrance. Mab, the kitchen mistress, stopped singing as the door opened, then eyed Siri.\n\n\u201cYour father\u2019s been looking for you, child,\u201d Mab said, turning away and humming as she attacked a pile of onions.\n\n\u201cI suspect that he has.\u201d Siri walked over and sniffed at a pot, which bore the calm scent of boiling potatoes.\n\n\u201cWent to the hills again, didn\u2019t you? Skipped your tutorial sessions, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d\n\nSiri smiled, then pulled out another of the bright yellow flowers, spinning it between two fingers.\n\nMab rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd been corrupting the city youth again, I suspect. Honestly, girl, you should be beyond these things at your age. Your father will have words with you about shirking your responsibilities.\u201d\n\u201cI like words,\u201d Siri said. \u201cAnd I always learn a few new ones when Father gets angry. I shouldn\u2019t neglect my education, now should I?\u201d\n\nMab snorted, dicing some pickled cucumbers into the onions.\n\n\u201cHonestly, Mab,\u201d Siri said, twirling the flower, feeling her hair shade a little bit red. \u201cI don\u2019t see what the problem is. Austre made the flowers, right? He put the colors on them, so they can\u2019t be evil. I mean, we call him God of Colors, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlowers ain\u2019t evil,\u201d Mab said, adding something that looked like grass to her concoction, \u201cassuming they\u2019re left where Austre put them. We shouldn\u2019t use Austre\u2019s beauty to make ourselves more important.\u201d\n\n\u201cA flower doesn\u2019t make me look more important.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Mab asked, adding the grass, cucumber, and onions to one of her boiling pots. She banged the side of the pot with the flat of her knife, listening, then nodded to herself and began fishing under the counter for more vegetables. \u201cYou tell me,\u201d she continued, voice muffled. \u201cYou really think walking through the city with a flower like that didn\u2019t draw attention to yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s only because the city is so drab. If there were a bit of color around, nobody would notice a flower.\u201d\n\nMab reappeared, hefting a box filled with various tubers. \u201cYou\u2019d have us decorate the place like Hallandren? Maybe we should start inviting Awakeners into the city? How\u2019d you like that? Some dev il sucking the souls out of children, strangling people with their own clothing? Bringing men back from the grave, then using their dead bodies for cheap labor? Sacrificing women on their unholy altars?\u201d\n\nSiri felt her hair whiten slightly with anxiety. Stop that! she thought. The hair seemed to have a mind of its own, responding to gut feelings.\n\n\u201cThat sacrificing-maidens part is only a story,\u201d Siri said. \u201cThey don\u2019t really do that.\u201d \u201cStories come from somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they come from old women sitting by the hearth in the winter. I don\u2019t think we need to be so frightened. The Hallandren will do what they want, which is fine by me, as long as they leave us alone.\u201d\n\nMab chopped tubers, not looking up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the treaty, Mab,\u201d Siri said. \u201cFather and Vivenna will make sure we\u2019re safe, and that will make the Hallandren leave us alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if they don\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have better armies,\u201d Mab said, chopping, not looking up, \u201cbetter steel, more food, and those . . .\n\nthose things. It makes people worry. Maybe not you, but sensible folk.\u201d\nThe cook\u2019s words were hard to dismiss out of hand. Mab had a sense, a wisdom beyond her instinct for spices and broths. However, she also tended to fret. \u201cYou\u2019re worrying about nothing, Mab. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying that this is a bad time for a royal princess to be running around with flowers, standin\u2019 out and inviting Austre\u2019s dislike.\u201d\n\nSiri sighed. \u201cFine, then,\u201d she said, tossing her last flower into the stewpot. \u201cNow we can all stand out together.\u201d\n\nMab froze, then rolled her eyes, chopping a root. \u201cI assume that was a vanavel flower?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Siri said, sniffing at the steaming pot. \u201cI know better than to ruin a good stew. And I still say you\u2019re overreacting.\u201d\n\nMab sniffed. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, pulling out another knife. \u201cMake yourself useful. There\u2019s roots that need choppin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t I report to my father?\u201d Siri said, grabbing a gnarled vanavel root and beginning to chop.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll just send you back here and make you work in the kitchens as a punishment,\u201d Mab said, banging the pot with her knife again. She firmly believed that she could judge when a dish was done by the way the pot rang.\n\n\u201cAustre help me if Father ever discovers I like it down here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just like being close to the food,\u201d Mab said, fishing Siri\u2019s flower out of the stew, then tossing it aside. \u201cEither way, you can\u2019t report to him. He\u2019s in conference with Yarda.\u201d\n\nSiri gave no reaction\u2014she simply continued to chop. Her hair, however, grew blond with excitement. Father\u2019s conferences with Yarda usually last hours, she thought. Not much point in simply sitting around, waiting for him to get done. . . .\n\nMab turned to get something off the table, and before she looked back, Siri bolted out the door on her way toward the royal stables. Bare minutes later, she galloped away from the palace, wearing her favorite brown cloak, feeling an exhilarated thrill that sent her hair into a deep blond. A nice quick ride would be a good way to round out the day.\n\nAfter all, her punishment was likely to be the same either way.\n\n\n\nDedelin, king of Idris, set the letter down on his desk. He had stared at it long enough. It was time to decide whether or not to send his eldest daughter to her death.\n\nDespite the advent of spring, his chamber was cold. Warmth was a rare thing in the Idris highlands; it was coveted and enjoyed, for it lingered only briefly each summer. The chambers were also stark. There was a beauty in simplicity. Even a king had no right to display arrogance by ostentation.\n\nDedelin stood up, looking out his window and into the courtyard. The palace was small by the world\u2019s standards\u2014only a single story high, with a peaked wooden roof and squat stone walls. But it was large\nby Idrian standards, and it bordered on flamboyant. This could be forgiven, for the palace was also a meeting hall and center of operations for his entire kingdom.\n\nThe king could see General Yarda out of the corner of his eye. The burly man stood waiting, his hands clasped behind his back, his thick beard tied in three places. He was the only other person in the room.\n\nDedelin glanced back at the letter. The paper was a bright pink, and the garish color stood out on his desk like a drop of blood in the snow. Pink was a color one would never see in Idris. In Hallandren, however\u2014center of the world\u2019s dye industry\u2014such tasteless hues were commonplace.\n\n\u201cWell, old friend?\u201d Dedelin asked. \u201cDo you have any advice for me?\u201d\n\nGeneral Yarda shook his head. \u201cWar is coming, Your Majesty. I feel it in the winds and read it in the reports of our spies. Hallandren still considers us rebels, and our passes to the north are too tempting. They will attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I shouldn\u2019t send her,\u201d Dedelin said, looking back out his window. The courtyard bustled with people in furs and cloaks coming to market.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop the war, Your Majesty,\u201d Yarda said. \u201cBut . . . we can slow it.\u201d Dedelin turned back.\n\nYarda stepped forward, speaking softly. \u201cThis is not a good time. Our troops still haven\u2019t recovered from those Vendis raids last fall, and with the fires in the granary this winter . . .\u201d Yarda shook his head. \u201cWe cannot afford to get into a defensive war in the summer. Our best ally against the Hallandren is the snow. We can\u2019t let this conflict occur on their terms. If we do, we are dead.\u201d\n\nThe words all made sense.\n\n\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d Yarda said, \u201cthey are waiting for us to break the treaty as an excuse to attack. If we move first, they will strike.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we keep the treaty, they will still strike,\u201d Dedelin said.\n\n\u201cBut later. Perhaps months later. You know how slow Hallandren politics are. If we keep the treaty, there will be debates and arguments. If those last until the snows, then we will have gained the time we need so badly.\u201d\n\nIt all made sense. Brutal, honest sense. All these years, Dedelin had stalled and watched as the Hallandren court grew more and more aggressive, more and more agitated. Every year, voices called for an assault on the \u201crebel Idrians\u201d living up in the highlands. Every year, those voices grew louder and more plentiful. Every year, Dedelin\u2019s placating and politics kept the armies away. He had hoped, perhaps, that the rebel leader Vahr and his Pahn Kahl dissidents would draw attention away from Idris, but Vahr had been captured, his so-called army dispersed. His actions had only served to make Hallandren more focused on its enemies.\n\nThe peace would not last. Not with Idris ripe, not with the trade routes worth so much. Not with the current crop of Hallandren gods, who seemed so much more erratic than their predecessors.\nHe knew all of that. But he also knew that breaking the treaty would be foolish. When you were cast into the den of a beast, you did not provoke it to anger.\n\nYarda joined him beside the window, looking out, leaning one elbow against the side of the frame. He was a harsh man born of harsh winters. But he was also as good a man as Dedelin had ever known\u2014a part of the king longed to marry Vivenna to the general\u2019s own son.\n\nThat was foolishness. Dedelin had always known this day would come. He\u2019d crafted the treaty himself, and it demanded he send his daughter to marry the God King. The Hallandren needed a daughter of the royal blood to reintroduce the traditional bloodline into their monarchy. It was something the depraved and vainglorious people of the lowlands had long coveted, and only that specific clause in the treaty had saved Idris these twenty years.\n\nThat treaty had been the first official act of Dedelin\u2019s reign, negotiated furiously following his father\u2019s assassination. Dedelin gritted his teeth. How quickly he\u2019d bowed before the whims of his enemies. Yet he would do it again; an Idrian monarch would do anything for his people. That was one big difference between Idris and Hallandren.\n\n\u201cIf we send her, Yarda,\u201d Dedelin said, \u201cwe send her to her death.\u201d \u201cMaybe they won\u2019t harm her,\u201d Yarda finally said.\n\n\u201cYou know better than that. The first thing they\u2019ll do when war comes is use her against me. This is Hallandren. They invite Awakeners into their palaces, for Austre\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\nYarda fell silent. Finally, he shook his head. \u201cLatest reports say their army has grown to include some forty thousand Lifeless.\u201d\n\nLord God of Colors, Dedelin thought, glancing at the letter again. Its language was simple. Vivenna\u2019s twenty-second birthday had come, and the terms of the treaty stipulated that Dedelin could wait no longer.\n\n\u201cSending Vivenna is a poor plan, but it\u2019s our only plan,\u201d Yarda said. \u201cWith more time, I know I can bring the Tedradel to our cause\u2014they\u2019ve hated Hallandren since the Manywar. And perhaps I can find a way to rile Vahr\u2019s broken rebel faction in Hallandren itself. At the very least, we can build, gather supplies, live another year.\u201d Yarda turned to him. \u201cIf we don\u2019t send the Hallandren their princess, the war will be seen as our fault. Who will support us? They will demand to know why we refused to follow the treaty our own king wrote!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if we do send them Vivenna, it will introduce the royal blood into their monarchy, and that will have an even more legitimate claim on the highlands!\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Yarda said. \u201cBut if we both know they\u2019re going to attack anyway, then what do we care about their claim? At least this way, perhaps they will wait until an heir is born before the assault comes.\u201d\n\nMore time. The general always asked for more time. But what about when that time came at the cost of Dedelin\u2019s own child?\nYarda wouldn\u2019t hesitate to send one soldier to die if it would mean time enough to get the rest of his troops into better position to attack, Dedelin thought. We are Idris. How can I ask anything less of my daughter than I\u2019d demand of one of my troops?\n\nIt was just that thinking of Vivenna in the God King\u2019s arms, being forced to bear that creature\u2019s\n\nchild . . . it nearly made his hair bleach with concern. That child would become a stillborn monster who would become the next Returned god of the Hallandren.\n\nThere is another way, a part of his mind whispered. You don\u2019t have to send Vivenna. . . .\n\nA knock came at his door. Both he and Yarda turned, and Dedelin called for the visitor to enter. He should have been able to guess who it would be.\n\nVivenna stood in a quiet grey dress, looking so young to him still. Yet she was the perfect image of an Idrian woman\u2014hair kept in a modest knot, no makeup to draw attention to the face. She was not timid or soft, like some noblewomen from the northern kingdoms. She was just composed. Composed, simple, hard, and capable. Idrian.\n\n\u201cYou have been in here for several hours, Father,\u201d Vivenna said, bowing her head respectfully to Yarda. \u201cThe servants speak of a colorful envelope carried by the general when he entered. I believe I know what it contained.\u201d\n\nDedelin met her eyes, then waved for her to seat herself. She softly closed the door, then took one of the wooden chairs from the side of the room. Yarda remained standing, after the masculine fashion. Vivenna eyed the letter sitting on the desk. She was calm, her hair controlled and kept a respectful black. She was twice as devout as Dedelin, and\u2014unlike her youngest sister\u2014she never drew attention to herself with fits of emotion.\n\n\u201cI assume that I should prepare myself for departure, then,\u201d Vivenna said, hands in her lap.\n\nDedelin opened his mouth, but could find no objection. He glanced at Yarda, who just shook his head, resigned.\n\n\u201cI have prepared my entire life for this, Father,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cI am ready. Siri, however, will not take this well. She left on a ride an hour ago. I should depart the city before she gets back. That will avoid any potential scene she might make.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo late,\u201d Yarda said, grimacing and nodding toward the window. Just outside, people scattered in the courtyard as a figure galloped through the gates. She wore a deep brown cloak that bordered on being too colorful, and\u2014of course\u2014she had her hair down.\n\nThe hair was yellow.\n\nDedelin felt his rage and frustration growing. Only Siri could make him lose control, and\u2014as if in ironic counterpoint to the source of his anger\u2014he felt his hair change. To those watching, a few locks of hair on his head would have bled from black to red. It was the identifying mark of the royal family, who had fled to the Idris highlands at the climax of the Manywar. Others could hide their emotions. The royals, however, manifested what they felt in the very hair on their heads.\nVivenna watched him, pristine as always, and her poise gave him strength as he forced his hair to turn black again. It took more willpower than any common man could understand to control the treasonous Royal Locks. Dedelin wasn\u2019t sure how Vivenna managed it so well.\n\nPoor girl never even had a childhood, he thought. From birth, Vivenna\u2019s life had been pointed toward this single event. His firstborn child, the girl who had always seemed like a part of himself. The girl who had always made him proud; the woman who had already earned the love and respect of her people. In his mind\u2019s eye he saw the queen she could become, stronger even than he. Someone who could guide them through the dark days ahead.\n\nBut only if she survived that long.\n\n\u201cI will prepare myself for the trip,\u201d Vivenna said, rising.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dedelin said.\n\nYarda and Vivenna both turned.\n\n\u201cFather,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cIf we break this treaty, it will mean war. I am prepared to sacrifice for our people. You taught me that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not go,\u201d Dedelin said firmly, turning back toward the window. Outside, Siri was laughing with one of the stablemen. Dedelin could hear her outburst even from a distance; her hair had turned a flame-colored red.\n\nLord God of Colors, forgive me, he thought. What a terrible choice for a father to make. The treaty is specific: I must send the Hallandren my daughter when Vivenna reaches her twenty-second birthday. But it doesn\u2019t actually say which daughter I am required to send.\n\nIf he didn\u2019t send Hallandren one of his daughters, they would attack immediately. If he sent the wrong one, they might be angered, but he knew they wouldn\u2019t attack. They would wait until they had an heir. That would gain Idris at least nine months.\n\nAnd . . . he thought, if they were to try to use Vivenna against me, I know that I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop myself from giving in. It was shameful to admit that fact, but in the end, it was what made the decision for him.\n\nDedelin turned back toward the room. \u201cVivenna, you will not go to wed the tyrant god of our enemies. I\u2019m sending Siri in your place.\u201d\n\nLightsong didn\u2019t remember dying.\n\nHis priests, however, assured him that his death had been extremely inspiring. Noble. Grand. Heroic. One did not Return unless one died in a way that exemplified the great virtues of human existence. That was why the Iridescent Tones sent the Returned back; they acted as examples, and gods, to the people who still lived.\n\nEach god represented something. An ideal related to the heroic way in which they had died. Lightsong\n\nhimself had died displaying extreme bravery. Or, at least, that was what his priests told him. Lightsong\n\ncouldn\u2019t remember the event, just as he couldn\u2019t remember anything of his life before he became a god.\nHe groaned softly, unable to sleep any longer. He rolled over, feeling weak as he sat up in his majestic bed. Visions and memories pestered his mind, and he shook his head, trying to clear away the fog of sleep.\n\nServants entered, responding wordlessly to their god\u2019s needs. He was one of the younger divinities, for he\u2019d Returned only five years before. There were some two dozen deities in the Court of Gods, and many were far more important\u2014and far more politically savvy\u2014than Lightsong. And above them all reigned Susebron, the God King of Hallandren.\n\nYoung though he was, he merited an enormous palace. He slept in a room draped with silks, dyed with bright reds and yellows. His palace held dozens of different chambers, all decorated and furnished according to his whims. Hundreds of servants and priests saw to his needs\u2014whether he wanted them seen to or not.\n\nAll of this, he thought as he stood, because I couldn\u2019t figure out how to die. Standing made him just a bit dizzy. It was his feast day. He would lack strength until he ate.\n\nServants approached carrying brilliant red and gold robes. As they entered his aura, each servant\u2014skin, hair, clothing, and garments\u2014burst with exaggerated color. The saturated hues were far more resplendent than any dye or paint could produce. That was an effect of Lightsong\u2019s innate BioChroma: he had enough Breath to fill thousands of people. He saw little value in it. He couldn\u2019t use it to animate objects or corpses; he was a god, not an Awakener. He couldn\u2019t give\u2014or even loan\u2014his deific Breath away.\n\nWell, except once. That would, however, kill him.\n\nThe servants continued their ministrations, draping him with gorgeous cloth. Lightsong was a good head and a half taller than anyone else in the room. He was also broad of shoulder, with a muscular physique that he didn\u2019t deserve, considering the amount of time he spent idle.\n\n\u201cDid you sleep well, Your Grace?\u201d a voice asked.\n\nLightsong turned. Llarimar, his high priest, was a tall, portly man with spectacles and a calm demeanor.\n\nHis hands were nearly hidden by the deep sleeves of his gold and red robe, and he carried a thick tome.\n\nBoth robes and tome burst with color as they entered Lightsong\u2019s aura.\n\n\u201cI slept fantastically, Scoot,\u201d Lightsong said, yawning. \u201cA night full of nightmares and obscure dreams, as always. Terribly restful.\u201d\n\nThe priest raised an eyebrow. \u201cScoot?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to give you a new nickname. Scoot. Seems to fit you, the way you\u2019re always scooting around, poking into things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am honored, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said, seating himself on a chair. Colors, Lightsong thought. Doesn\u2019t he ever get annoyed? Llarimar opened his tome. \u201cShall we begin?\u201d\n\u201cIf we must,\u201d Lightsong said. The servants finished tying ribbons, doing up clasps, and draping silks.\n\nEach bowed and retreated to a side of the room.\n\nLlarimar picked up his quill. \u201cWhat, then, do you remember of your dreams?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you know.\u201d Lightsong flopped back onto one of his couches, lounging. \u201cNothing really important.\u201d\n\nLlarimar pursed his lips in dis pleasure. Other servants began to file in, bearing various dishes of food. Mundane, human food. As a Returned, Lightsong didn\u2019t really need to eat such things\u2014they would not give him strength or banish his fatigue. They were just an indulgence. In a short time, he would dine on something far more . . . divine. It would give him strength enough to live for another week.\n\n\u201cPlease try to remember the dreams, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said in his polite, yet firm, way. \u201cNo matter how unremarkable they may seem.\u201d\n\nLightsong sighed, looking up at the ceiling. It was painted with a mural, of course. This one depicted three fields enclosed by stone walls. It was a vision one of his predecessors had seen. Lightsong closed his eyes, trying to focus. \u201cI . . . was walking along a beach,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a ship was leaving without me. I don\u2019t know where it was going.\u201d\n\nLlarimar\u2019s pen began to scratch quickly. He was probably finding all kinds of symbolism in the memory. \u201cWere there any colors?\u201d the priest asked.\n\n\u201cThe ship had a red sail,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cThe sand was brown, of course, and the trees green. For some reason, I think the ocean water was red, like the ship.\u201d\n\nLlarimar scribbled furiously\u2014he always got excited when Lightsong remembered colors. Lightsong opened his eyes and stared up at the ceiling and its brightly colored fields. He reached over idly, plucking some cherries off a servant\u2019s plate.\n\nWhy should he begrudge the people his dreams? Even if he found divination foolish, he had no right to complain. He was remarkably fortunate. He had a deific BioChromatic aura, a physique that any man would envy, and enough luxury for ten kings. Of all the people in the world, he had the least right to be difficult.\n\nIt was just that . . . well, he was probably the world\u2019s only god who didn\u2019t believe in his own religion. \u201cWas there anything else to the dream, Your Grace?\u201d Llarimar asked, looking up from his book. \u201cYou were there, Scoot.\u201d\n\nLlarimar paused, paling just slightly. \u201cI . . . was?\u201d\n\nLightsong nodded. \u201cYou apologized for bothering me all the time and keeping me from my debauchery. Then you brought me a big bottle of wine and did a dance. It was really quite remarkable.\u201d\n\nLlarimar regarded him with a flat stare.\n\nLightsong sighed. \u201cNo, there was nothing else. Just the boat. Even that is fading.\u201d\nLlarimar nodded, rising and shooing back the servants\u2014though, of course, they remained in the room, hovering with their plates of nuts, wine, and fruit, should any of it be wanted. \u201cShall we get on with it then, Your Grace?\u201d Llarimar asked.\n\nLightsong sighed, then rose, exhausted. A servant scuttled forward to redo one of the clasps on his robe, which had come undone as he sat.\n\nLightsong fell into step beside Llarimar, towering at least a foot over the priest. The furniture and doorways, however, were built to fit Lightsong\u2019s increased size, so it was the servants and priests who seemed out of place. They passed from room to room, using no hallways. Hallways were for servants, and they ran in a square around the outside of the building. Lightsong walked on plush rugs from the northern nations, passing the finest pottery from across the Inner Sea. Each room was hung with paintings and gracefully calligraphed poems, created by Hallandren\u2019s finest artists.\n\nAt the center of the palace was a small, square room that deviated from the standard reds and golds of Lightsong\u2019s motif. This one was bright with ribbons of darker colors\u2014deep blues, greens, and blood reds. Each was a true color, directly on hue, as only a person who had attained the Third Heightening could distinguish.\n\nAs Lightsong stepped into the room, the colors blazed to life. They became brighter, more intense, yet somehow remained dark. The maroon became a more true maroon, the navy a more powerful navy. Dark yet bright, a contrast only Breath could inspire.\n\nIn the center of the room was a child.\n\nWhy does it always have to be a child? Lightsong thought.\n\nLlarimar and the servants waited. Lightsong stepped forward, and the little girl glanced to the side, where a couple of priests stood in red and gold robes. They nodded encouragingly. The girl looked back toward Lightsong, obviously nervous.\n\n\u201cHere now,\u201d Lightsong said, trying to sound encouraging. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to fear.\u201d And yet, the girl trembled.\n\nLecture after lecture\u2014delivered by Llarimar, who had claimed that they were not lectures, for one did not lecture gods\u2014drifted through Lightsong\u2019s head. There was nothing to fear from the Returned gods of the Hallandren. The gods were a blessing. They provided visions of the future, as well as leadership and wisdom. All they needed to subsist was one thing.\n\nBreath.\n\nLightsong hesitated, but his weakness was coming to a head. He felt dizzy. Cursing himself quietly, he knelt down on one knee, taking the girl\u2019s face in his oversized hands. She began to cry, but she said the words, clear and distinct as she had been taught. \u201cMy life to yours. My Breath become yours.\u201d\n\nHer Breath flowed out, puffing in the air. It traveled along Lightsong\u2019s arm\u2014the touch was necessary \u2014and he drew it in. His weakness vanished, the dizziness evaporated. Both were replaced with crisp clarity. He felt invigorated, revitalized, alive.\nThe girl grew dull. The color of her lips and eyes faded slightly. Her brown hair lost some of its luster; her cheeks became more bland.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing, he thought. Most people say they can\u2019t even tell that their Breath is gone. She\u2019ll live a full life. Happy. Her family will be well paid for her sacrifice.\n"], "title": ["Warbreaker"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson"]}
