A life crowded with incident, I see; though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young girl.  I am not myself in favour of premature experiences.  [Rises, looks at her watch.]  Gwendolen! the time approaches for our departure.  We have not a moment to lose.  As a matter of form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little fortune?\n\nJack.  Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds.  That is all.  Goodbye, Lady Bracknell.  So pleased to have seen you.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Sitting down again.]  A moment, Mr. Worthing.  A hundred and thirty thousand pounds!  And in the Funds!  Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.  Few girls of the present day have any really solid qualities, any of the qualities that last, and improve with time.  We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.  [To Cecily.]  Come over here, dear.  [Cecily goes across.]  Pretty child! your dress is sadly simple, and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it.  But we can soon alter all that.  A thoroughly experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space of time.  I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing, and after three months her own husband did not know her.\n\nJack.  And after six months nobody knew her.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Glares at Jack for a few moments.  Then bends, with a practised smile, to Cecily.]  Kindly turn round, sweet child.  [Cecily turns completely round.]  No, the side view is what I want.  [Cecily presents her profile.]  Yes, quite as I expected.  There are distinct social possibilities in your profile.  The two weak points in our age are its want of principle and its want of profile.  The chin a little higher, dear.  Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn.  They are worn very high, just at present.  Algernon!\n\nAlgernon.  Yes, Aunt Augusta!\n\nLady Bracknell.  There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew\u2019s profile.\n\nAlgernon.  Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole world.  And I don\u2019t care twopence about social possibilities.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.  Only people who can\u2019t get into it do that.  [To Cecily.]  Dear child, of course you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon.  But I do not approve of mercenary marriages.  When I married Lord Bracknell I had no fortune of any kind.  But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand in my way.  Well, I suppose I must give my consent.\n\nAlgernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Cecily, you may kiss me!\n\nCecily.  [Kisses her.]  Thank you, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLady Bracknell.  You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.\n\nCecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.\n\nAlgernon.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nCecily.  Thank you, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements.  They give people the opportunity of finding out each other\u2019s character before marriage, which I think is never advisable.\n\nJack.  I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell, but this engagement is quite out of the question.  I am Miss Cardew\u2019s guardian, and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age.  That consent I absolutely decline to give.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Upon what grounds may I ask?  Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man.  He has nothing, but he looks everything.  What more can one desire?\n\nJack.  It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his moral character.  I suspect him of being untruthful.  [Algernon and Cecily look at him in indignant amazement.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  Untruthful!  My nephew Algernon?  Impossible!  He is an Oxonian.\n\nJack.  I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.  This afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question of romance, he obtained admission to my house by means of the false pretence of being my brother.  Under an assumed name he drank, I\u2019ve just been informed by my butler, an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet, Brut, \u201989; wine I was specially reserving for myself.  Continuing his disgraceful deception, he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward.  He subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every single muffin.  And what makes his conduct all the more heartless is, that he was perfectly well aware from the first that I have no brother, that I never had a brother, and that I don\u2019t intend to have a brother, not even of any kind.  I distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided entirely to overlook my nephew\u2019s conduct to you.\n\nJack.  That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell.  My own decision, however, is unalterable.  I decline to give my consent.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [To Cecily.]  Come here, sweet child.  [Cecily goes over.]  How old are you, dear?\n\nCecily.  Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go to evening parties.\n\nLady Bracknell.  You are perfectly right in making some slight alteration.  Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her age.  It looks so calculating . . . [In a meditative manner.]  Eighteen, but admitting to twenty at evening parties.  Well, it will not be very long before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.  So I don\u2019t think your guardian\u2019s consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.\n\nJack.  Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again, but it is only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather\u2019s will Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.\n\nLady Bracknell.  That does not seem to me to be a grave objection.  Thirty-five is a very attractive age.  London society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice, remained thirty-five for years.  Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.  To my own knowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty, which was many years ago now.  I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at present.  There will be a large accumulation of property.\n\nCecily.  Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?\n\nAlgernon.  Of course I could, Cecily.  You know I could.\n\nCecily.  Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn\u2019t wait all that time.  I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody.  It always makes me rather cross.  I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others, and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.\n\nAlgernon.  Then what is to be done, Cecily?\n\nCecily.  I don\u2019t know, Mr. Moncrieff.\n\nLady Bracknell.  My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively that she cannot wait till she is thirty-five\u2014a remark which I am bound to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature\u2014I would beg of you to reconsider your decision.\n\nJack.  But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands.  The moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen, I will most gladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Rising and drawing herself up.]  You must be quite aware that what you propose is out of the question.\n\nJack.  Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to.\n\nLady Bracknell.  That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.  Algernon, of course, can choose for himself.  [Pulls out her watch.]  Come, dear, [Gwendolen rises] we have already missed five, if not six, trains.  To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform.\n\n[Enter Dr. Chasuble.]\n\nChasuble.  Everything is quite ready for the christenings.\n\nLady Bracknell.  The christenings, sir!  Is not that somewhat premature?\n\nChasuble.  [Looking rather puzzled, and pointing to Jack and Algernon.]  Both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.\n\nLady Bracknell.  At their age?  The idea is grotesque and irreligious!  Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized.  I will not hear of such excesses.  Lord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was the way in which you wasted your time and money.\n\nChasuble.  Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all this afternoon?\n\nJack.  I don\u2019t think that, as things are now, it would be of much practical value to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.\n\nChasuble.  I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing.  They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists, views that I have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.  However, as your present mood seems to be one peculiarly secular, I will return to the church at once.  Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that for the last hour and a half Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the vestry.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Starting.]  Miss Prism!  Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?\n\nChasuble.  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I am on my way to join her.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Pray allow me to detain you for a moment.  This matter may prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself.  Is this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?\n\nChasuble.  [Somewhat indignantly.]  She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the very picture of respectability.\n\nLady Bracknell.  It is obviously the same person.  May I ask what position she holds in your household?\n\nChasuble.  [Severely.]  I am a celibate, madam.\n\nJack.  [Interposing.]  Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three years Miss Cardew\u2019s esteemed governess and valued companion.\n\nLady Bracknell.  In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once.  Let her be sent for.\n\nChasuble.  [Looking off.]  She approaches; she is nigh.\n\n[Enter Miss Prism hurriedly.]\n\nMiss Prism.  I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon.  I have been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.  [Catches sight of Lady Bracknell, who has fixed her with a stony glare.  Miss Prism grows pale and quails.  She looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  [In a severe, judicial voice.]  Prism!  [Miss Prism bows her head in shame.]  Come here, Prism!  [Miss Prism approaches in a humble manner.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [General consternation.  The Canon starts back in horror.  Algernon and Jack pretend to be anxious to shield Cecily and Gwendolen from hearing the details of a terrible public scandal.]  Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell\u2019s house, Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street, in charge of a perambulator that contained a baby of the male sex.  You never returned.  A few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police, the perambulator was discovered at midnight, standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater.  It contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality.  [Miss Prism starts in involuntary indignation.]  But the baby was not there!  [Every one looks at Miss Prism.]  Prism!  Where is that baby?  [A pause.]\n\nMiss Prism.  Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know.  I only wish I did.  The plain facts of the case are these.  On the morning of the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.  I had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few unoccupied hours.  In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never can forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and placed the baby in the hand-bag.\n\nJack.  [Who has been listening attentively.]  But where did you deposit the hand-bag?\n\nMiss Prism.  Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.\n\nJack.  Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me.  I insist on knowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.\n\nMiss Prism.  I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in London.\n\nJack.  What railway station?\n\nMiss Prism.  [Quite crushed.]  Victoria.  The Brighton line.  [Sinks into a chair.]\n\nJack.  I must retire to my room for a moment.  Gwendolen, wait here for me.\n\nGwendolen.  If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.  [Exit Jack in great excitement.]\n\nChasuble.  What do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?\n\nLady Bracknell.  I dare not even suspect, Dr. Chasuble.  I need hardly tell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are not supposed to occur.  They are hardly considered the thing.\n\n[Noises heard overhead as if some one was throwing trunks about.  Every one looks up.]\n\nCecily.  Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated.\n\nChasuble.  Your guardian has a very emotional nature.\n\nLady Bracknell.  This noise is extremely unpleasant.  It sounds as if he was having an argument.  I dislike arguments of any kind.  They are always vulgar, and often convincing.\n\nChasuble.  [Looking up.]  It has stopped now.  [The noise is redoubled.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  I wish he would arrive at some conclusion.\n\nGwendolen.  This suspense is terrible.  I hope it will last.  [Enter Jack with a hand-bag of black leather in his hand.]\n\nJack.  [Rushing over to Miss Prism.]  Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism?  Examine it carefully before you speak.  The happiness of more than one life depends on your answer.\n\nMiss Prism.  [Calmly.]  It seems to be mine.  Yes, here is the injury it received through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier days.  Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington.  And here, on the lock, are my initials.  I had forgotten that in an extravagant mood I had had them placed there.  The bag is undoubtedly mine.  I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.  It has been a great inconvenience being without it all these years.\n\nJack.  [In a pathetic voice.]  Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this hand-bag.  I was the baby you placed in it.\n\nMiss Prism.  [Amazed.]  You?\n\nJack.  [Embracing her.]  Yes . . . mother!\n\nMiss Prism.  [Recoiling in indignant astonishment.]  Mr. Worthing!  I am unmarried!\n\nJack.  Unmarried!  I do not deny that is a serious blow.  But after all, who has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered?  Cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly?  Why should there be one law for men, and another for women?  Mother, I forgive you.  [Tries to embrace her again.]\n\nMiss Prism.  [Still more indignant.]  Mr. Worthing, there is some error.  [Pointing to Lady Bracknell.]  There is the lady who can tell you who you really are.\n\nJack.  [After a pause.]  Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would you kindly inform me who I am?\n\nLady Bracknell.  I am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please you.  You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff, and consequently Algernon\u2019s elder brother.\n\nJack.  Algy\u2019s elder brother!  Then I have a brother after all.  I knew I had a brother!  I always said I had a brother!  Cecily,\u2014how could you have ever doubted that I had a brother?  [Seizes hold of Algernon.]  Dr. Chasuble, my unfortunate brother.  Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.  Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother.  Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to treat me with more respect in the future.  You have never behaved to me like a brother in all your life.\n\nAlgernon.  Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.  I did my best, however, though I was out of practice.\n\n[Shakes hands.]\n\nGwendolen.  [To Jack.]  My own!  But what own are you?  What is your Christian name, now that you have become some one else?\n\nJack.  Good heavens! . . . I had quite forgotten that point.  Your decision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?\n\nGwendolen.  I never change, except in my affections.\n\nCecily.  What a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!\n\nJack.  Then the question had better be cleared up at once.  Aunt Augusta, a moment.  At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I been christened already?\n\nLady Bracknell.  Every luxury that money could buy, including christening, had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents.\n\nJack.  Then I was christened!  That is settled.  Now, what name was I given?  Let me know the worst.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Being the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father.\n\nJack.  [Irritably.]  Yes, but what was my father\u2019s Christian name?\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Meditatively.]  I cannot at the present moment recall what the General\u2019s Christian name was.  But I have no doubt he had one.  He was eccentric, I admit.  But only in later years.  And that was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of that kind.\n\nJack.  Algy!  Can\u2019t you recollect what our father\u2019s Christian name was?\n\nAlgernon.  My dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms.  He died before I was a year old.\n\nJack.  His name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose, Aunt Augusta?\n\nLady Bracknell.  The General was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic life.  But I have no doubt his name would appear in any military directory.\n\nJack.  The Army Lists of the last forty years are here.  These delightful records should have been my constant study.  [Rushes to bookcase and tears the books out.]  M. Generals . . . Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what ghastly names they have\u2014Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!  Lieutenant 1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869, Christian names, Ernest John.  [Puts book very quietly down and speaks quite calmly.]  I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn\u2019t I?  Well, it is Ernest after all.  I mean it naturally is Ernest.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Yes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest, I knew I had some particular reason for disliking the name.\n\nGwendolen.  Ernest!  My own Ernest!  I felt from the first that you could have no other name!\n\nJack.  Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.  Can you forgive me?\n\nGwendolen.  I can.  For I feel that you are sure to change.\n\nJack.  My own one!\n\nChasuble.  [To Miss Prism.]  L\u00e6titia!  [Embraces her]\n\nMiss Prism.  [Enthusiastically.]  Frederick!  At last!\n\nAlgernon.  Cecily!  [Embraces her.]  At last!\n\nJack.  Gwendolen!  [Embraces her.]  At last!\n\nLady Bracknell.  My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality.\n\nJack.  On the contrary, Aunt Augusta, I\u2019ve now realised for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.\n\nTABLEAU\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST***\n\n\n\n***** This file should be named 844-h.htm or 844-h.zip******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/8/4/844\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"], "title": ["The Importance of Being Earnest"], "author": ["Oscar Wilde"]}
