The sound of a piano is heard in the adjoining room.\n\n[Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has ceased, Algernon enters.]\n\nAlgernon.  Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?\n\nLane.  I didn\u2019t think it polite to listen, sir.\n\nAlgernon.  I\u2019m sorry for that, for your sake.  I don\u2019t play accurately\u2014any one can play accurately\u2014but I play with wonderful expression.  As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.  I keep science for Life.\n\nLane.  Yes, sir.\n\nAlgernon.  And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?\n\nLane.  Yes, sir.  [Hands them on a salver.]\n\nAlgernon.  [Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.]  Oh! . . . by the way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are entered as having been consumed.\n\nLane.  Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.\n\nAlgernon.  Why is it that at a bachelor\u2019s establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?  I ask merely for information.\n\nLane.  I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.  I have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.\n\nAlgernon.  Good heavens!  Is marriage so demoralising as that?\n\nLane.  I believe it is a very pleasant state, sir.  I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present.  I have only been married once.  That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person.\n\nAlgernon.  [Languidly.]  I don\u2019t know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane.\n\nLane.  No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject.  I never think of it myself.\n\nAlgernon.  Very natural, I am sure.  That will do, Lane, thank you.\n\nLane.  Thank you, sir.  [Lane goes out.]\n\nAlgernon.  Lane\u2019s views on marriage seem somewhat lax.  Really, if the lower orders don\u2019t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?  They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLane.  Mr. Ernest Worthing.\n\n[Enter Jack.]\n\n[Lane goes out.]\n\nAlgernon.  How are you, my dear Ernest?  What brings you up to town?\n\nJack.  Oh, pleasure, pleasure!  What else should bring one anywhere?  Eating as usual, I see, Algy!\n\nAlgernon.  [Stiffly.]  I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o\u2019clock.  Where have you been since last Thursday?\n\nJack.  [Sitting down on the sofa.]  In the country.\n\nAlgernon.  What on earth do you do there?\n\nJack.  [Pulling off his gloves.]  When one is in town one amuses oneself.  When one is in the country one amuses other people.  It is excessively boring.\n\nAlgernon.  And who are the people you amuse?\n\nJack.  [Airily.]  Oh, neighbours, neighbours.\n\nAlgernon.  Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?\n\nJack.  Perfectly horrid!  Never speak to one of them.\n\nAlgernon.  How immensely you must amuse them!  [Goes over and takes sandwich.]  By the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?\n\nJack.  Eh?  Shropshire?  Yes, of course.  Hallo!  Why all these cups?  Why cucumber sandwiches?  Why such reckless extravagance in one so young?  Who is coming to tea?\n\nAlgernon.  Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.\n\nJack.  How perfectly delightful!\n\nAlgernon.  Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won\u2019t quite approve of your being here.\n\nJack.  May I ask why?\n\nAlgernon.  My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful.  It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.\n\nJack.  I am in love with Gwendolen.  I have come up to town expressly to propose to her.\n\nAlgernon.  I thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that business.\n\nJack.  How utterly unromantic you are!\n\nAlgernon.  I really don\u2019t see anything romantic in proposing.  It is very romantic to be in love.  But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.  Why, one may be accepted.  One usually is, I believe.  Then the excitement is all over.  The very essence of romance is uncertainty.  If ever I get married, I\u2019ll certainly try to forget the fact.\n\nJack.  I have no doubt about that, dear Algy.  The Divorce Court was specially invented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.\n\nAlgernon.  Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject.  Divorces are made in Heaven\u2014[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich.  Algernon at once interferes.]  Please don\u2019t touch the cucumber sandwiches.  They are ordered specially for Aunt Augusta.  [Takes one and eats it.]\n\nJack.  Well, you have been eating them all the time.\n\nAlgernon.  That is quite a different matter.  She is my aunt.  [Takes plate from below.]  Have some bread and butter.  The bread and butter is for Gwendolen.  Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.\n\nJack.  [Advancing to table and helping himself.]  And very good bread and butter it is too.\n\nAlgernon.  Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it all.  You behave as if you were married to her already.  You are not married to her already, and I don\u2019t think you ever will be.\n\nJack.  Why on earth do you say that?\n\nAlgernon.  Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.  Girls don\u2019t think it right.\n\nJack.  Oh, that is nonsense!\n\nAlgernon.  It isn\u2019t.  It is a great truth.  It accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place.  In the second place, I don\u2019t give my consent.\n\nJack.  Your consent!\n\nAlgernon.  My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin.  And before I allow you to marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.  [Rings bell.]\n\nJack.  Cecily!  What on earth do you mean?  What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily!  I don\u2019t know any one of the name of Cecily.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nAlgernon.  Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the last time he dined here.\n\nLane.  Yes, sir.  [Lane goes out.]\n\nJack.  Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?  I wish to goodness you had let me know.  I have been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it.  I was very nearly offering a large reward.\n\nAlgernon.  Well, I wish you would offer one.  I happen to be more than usually hard up.\n\nJack.  There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.\n\n[Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver.  Algernon takes it at once.  Lane goes out.]\n\nAlgernon.  I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say.  [Opens case and examines it.]  However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the inscription inside, I find that the thing isn\u2019t yours after all.\n\nJack.  Of course it\u2019s mine.  [Moving to him.]  You have seen me with it a hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside.  It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.\n\nAlgernon.  Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and what one shouldn\u2019t.  More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn\u2019t read.\n\nJack.  I am quite aware of the fact, and I don\u2019t propose to discuss modern culture.  It isn\u2019t the sort of thing one should talk of in private.  I simply want my cigarette case back.\n\nAlgernon.  Yes; but this isn\u2019t your cigarette case.  This cigarette case is a present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn\u2019t know any one of that name.\n\nJack.  Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.\n\nAlgernon.  Your aunt!\n\nJack.  Yes.  Charming old lady she is, too.  Lives at Tunbridge Wells.  Just give it back to me, Algy.\n\nAlgernon.  [Retreating to back of sofa.]  But why does she call herself little Cecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells?  [Reading.]  \u2018From little Cecily with her fondest love.\u2019\n\nJack.  [Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.]  My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?  Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.  That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself.  You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt!  That is absurd!  For Heaven\u2019s sake give me back my cigarette case.  [Follows Algernon round the room.]\n\nAlgernon.  Yes.  But why does your aunt call you her uncle?  \u2018From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.\u2019  There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can\u2019t quite make out.  Besides, your name isn\u2019t Jack at all; it is Ernest.\n\nJack.  It isn\u2019t Ernest; it\u2019s Jack.\n\nAlgernon.  You have always told me it was Ernest.  I have introduced you to every one as Ernest.  You answer to the name of Ernest.  You look as if your name was Ernest.  You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life.  It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn\u2019t Ernest.  It\u2019s on your cards.  Here is one of them.  [Taking it from case.]  \u2018Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.\u2019  I\u2019ll keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to Gwendolen, or to any one else.  [Puts the card in his pocket.]\n\nJack.  Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country.\n\nAlgernon.  Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle.  Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.\n\nJack.  My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.  It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn\u2019t a dentist.  It produces a false impression.\n\nAlgernon.  Well, that is exactly what dentists always do.  Now, go on!  Tell me the whole thing.  I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.\n\nJack.  Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?\n\nAlgernon.  I\u2019ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack in the country.\n\nJack.  Well, produce my cigarette case first.\n\nAlgernon.  Here it is.  [Hands cigarette case.]  Now produce your explanation, and pray make it improbable.  [Sits on sofa.]\n\nJack.  My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all.  In fact it\u2019s perfectly ordinary.  Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew.  Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable governess, Miss Prism.\n\nAlgernon.  Where is that place in the country, by the way?\n\nJack.  That is nothing to you, dear boy.  You are not going to be invited . . . I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.\n\nAlgernon.  I suspected that, my dear fellow!  I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire on two separate occasions.  Now, go on.  Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the country?\n\nJack.  My dear Algy, I don\u2019t know whether you will be able to understand my real motives.  You are hardly serious enough.  When one is placed in the position of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects.  It\u2019s one\u2019s duty to do so.  And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either one\u2019s health or one\u2019s happiness, in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes.  That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.\n\nAlgernon.  The truth is rarely pure and never simple.  Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete impossibility!\n\nJack.  That wouldn\u2019t be at all a bad thing.\n\nAlgernon.  Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow.  Don\u2019t try it.  You should leave that to people who haven\u2019t been at a University.  They do it so well in the daily papers.  What you really are is a Bunburyist.  I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist.  You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.\n\nJack.  What on earth do you mean?\n\nAlgernon.  You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.  I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose.  Bunbury is perfectly invaluable.  If it wasn\u2019t for Bunbury\u2019s extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldn\u2019t be able to dine with you at Willis\u2019s to-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week.\n\nJack.  I haven\u2019t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.\n\nAlgernon.  I know.  You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations.  It is very foolish of you.  Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.\n\nJack.  You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.\n\nAlgernon.  I haven\u2019t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind.  To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one\u2019s own relations.  In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with either no woman at all, or two.  In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night.  She will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.  That is not very pleasant.  Indeed, it is not even decent . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.  The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous.  It looks so bad.  It is simply washing one\u2019s clean linen in public.  Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.  I want to tell you the rules.\n\nJack.  I\u2019m not a Bunburyist at all.  If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, indeed I think I\u2019ll kill him in any case.  Cecily is a little too much interested in him.  It is rather a bore.  So I am going to get rid of Ernest.  And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr. . . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.\n\nAlgernon.  Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury.  A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of it.\n\nJack.  That is nonsense.  If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly won\u2019t want to know Bunbury.\n\nAlgernon.  Then your wife will.  You don\u2019t seem to realise, that in married life three is company and two is none.\n\nJack.  [Sententiously.]  That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.\n\nAlgernon.  Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.\n\nJack.  For heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t try to be cynical.  It\u2019s perfectly easy to be cynical.\n\nAlgernon.  My dear fellow, it isn\u2019t easy to be anything nowadays.  There\u2019s such a lot of beastly competition about.  [The sound of an electric bell is heard.]  Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta.  Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.  Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to Gwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis\u2019s?\n\nJack.  I suppose so, if you want to.\n\nAlgernon.  Yes, but you must be serious about it.  I hate people who are not serious about meals.  It is so shallow of them.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLane.  Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.\n\n[Algernon goes forward to meet them.  Enter Lady Bracknell and Gwendolen.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.\n\nAlgernon.  I\u2019m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.\n\nLady Bracknell.  That\u2019s not quite the same thing.  In fact the two things rarely go together.  [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]\n\nAlgernon.  [To Gwendolen.]  Dear me, you are smart!\n\nGwendolen.  I am always smart!  Am I not, Mr. Worthing?\n\nJack.  You\u2019re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.\n\nGwendolen.  Oh! I hope I am not that.  It would leave no room for developments, and I intend to develop in many directions.  [Gwendolen and Jack sit down together in the corner.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  I\u2019m sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury.  I hadn\u2019t been there since her poor husband\u2019s death.  I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.  And now I\u2019ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.\n\nAlgernon.  Certainly, Aunt Augusta.  [Goes over to tea-table.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  Won\u2019t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?\n\nGwendolen.  Thanks, mamma, I\u2019m quite comfortable where I am.\n\nAlgernon.  [Picking up empty plate in horror.]  Good heavens!  Lane!  Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?  I ordered them specially.\n\nLane.  [Gravely.]  There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.  I went down twice.\n\nAlgernon.  No cucumbers!\n\nLane.  No, sir.  Not even for ready money.\n\nAlgernon.  That will do, Lane, thank you.\n\nLane.  Thank you, sir.  [Goes out.]\n\nAlgernon.  I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.\n\nLady Bracknell.  It really makes no matter, Algernon.  I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.\n\nAlgernon.  I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.\n\nLady Bracknell.  It certainly has changed its colour.  From what cause I, of course, cannot say.  [Algernon crosses and hands tea.]  Thank you.  I\u2019ve quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon.  I am going to send you down with Mary Farquhar.  She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.  It\u2019s delightful to watch them.\n\nAlgernon.  I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Frowning.]  I hope not, Algernon.  It would put my table completely out.  Your uncle would have to dine upstairs.  Fortunately he is accustomed to that.\n\nAlgernon.  It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.  [Exchanges glances with Jack.]  They seem to think I should be with him.\n\nLady Bracknell.  It is very strange.  This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health.\n\nAlgernon.  Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.  This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.  Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.  I consider it morbid.  Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.  Health is the primary duty of life.  I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any improvement in his ailment goes.  I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.  It is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation, particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not much.\n\nAlgernon.  I\u2019ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I think I can promise you he\u2019ll be all right by Saturday.  Of course the music is a great difficulty.  You see, if one plays good music, people don\u2019t listen, and if one plays bad music people don\u2019t talk.  But I\u2019ll run over the programme I\u2019ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Thank you, Algernon.  It is very thoughtful of you.  [Rising, and following Algernon.]  I\u2019m sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations.  French songs I cannot possibly allow.  People always seem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.  But German sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so.  Gwendolen, you will accompany me.\n\nGwendolen.  Certainly, mamma.\n\n[Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains behind.]\n\nJack.  Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.\n\nGwendolen.  Pray don\u2019t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing.  Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean something else.  And that makes me so nervous.\n\nJack.  I do mean something else.\n\nGwendolen.  I thought so.  In fact, I am never wrong.\n\nJack.  And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell\u2019s temporary absence . . .\n\nGwendolen.  I would certainly advise you to do so.  Mamma has a way of coming back suddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.\n\nJack.  [Nervously.]  Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more than any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.\n\nGwendolen.  Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.  And I often wish that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.  For me you have always had an irresistible fascination.  Even before I met you I was far from indifferent to you.  [Jack looks at her in amazement.]  We live, as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals.  The fact is constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has reached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been to love some one of the name of Ernest.  There is something in that name that inspires absolute confidence.  The moment Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love you.\n\nJack.  You really love me, Gwendolen?\n\nGwendolen.  Passionately!\n\nJack.  Darling!  You don\u2019t know how happy you\u2019ve made me.\n\nGwendolen.  My own Ernest!\n\nJack.  But you don\u2019t really mean to say that you couldn\u2019t love me if my name wasn\u2019t Ernest?\n\nGwendolen.  But your name is Ernest.\n\nJack.  Yes, I know it is.  But supposing it was something else?  Do you mean to say you couldn\u2019t love me then?\n\nGwendolen.  [Glibly.]  Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the actual facts of real life, as we know them.\n\nJack.  Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don\u2019t much care about the name of Ernest . . . I don\u2019t think the name suits me at all.\n\nGwendolen.  It suits you perfectly.  It is a divine name.  It has a music of its own.  It produces vibrations.\n\nJack.  Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of other much nicer names.  I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.\n\nGwendolen.  Jack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at all, indeed.  It does not thrill.  It produces absolutely no vibrations . . . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain.  Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John!  And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John.  She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment\u2019s solitude.  The only really safe name is Ernest.\n\nJack.  Gwendolen, I must get christened at once\u2014I mean we must get married at once.  There is no time to be lost.\n\nGwendolen.  Married, Mr. Worthing?\n\nJack.  [Astounded.]  Well . . . surely.  You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.\n\nGwendolen.  I adore you.  But you haven\u2019t proposed to me yet.  Nothing has been said at all about marriage.  The subject has not even been touched on.\n\nJack.  Well . . . may I propose to you now?\n\nGwendolen.  I think it would be an admirable opportunity.  And to spare you any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you quite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.\n\nJack.  Gwendolen!\n\nGwendolen.  Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?\n\nJack.  You know what I have got to say to you.\n\nGwendolen.  Yes, but you don\u2019t say it.\n\nJack.  Gwendolen, will you marry me?  [Goes on his knees.]\n\nGwendolen.  Of course I will, darling.  How long you have been about it!  I am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.\n\nJack.  My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.\n\nGwendolen.  Yes, but men often propose for practice.  I know my brother Gerald does.  All my girl-friends tell me so.  What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest!  They are quite, quite, blue.  I hope you will always look at me just like that, especially when there are other people present.  [Enter Lady Bracknell.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  Mr. Worthing!  Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture.  It is most indecorous.\n\nGwendolen.  Mamma!  [He tries to rise; she restrains him.]  I must beg you to retire.  This is no place for you.  Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished yet.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Finished what, may I ask?\n\nGwendolen.  I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.  [They rise together.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.  When you do become engaged to some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will inform you of the fact.  An engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.  It is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing.  While I am making these inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the carriage.\n\nGwendolen.  [Reproachfully.]  Mamma!\n\nLady Bracknell.  In the carriage, Gwendolen!  [Gwendolen goes to the door.  She and Jack blow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell\u2019s back.  Lady Bracknell looks vaguely about as if she could not understand what the noise was.  Finally turns round.]  Gwendolen, the carriage!\n\nGwendolen.  Yes, mamma.  [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Sitting down.]  You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.\n\n[Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]\n\nJack.  Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Pencil and note-book in hand.]  I feel bound to tell you that you are not down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.  We work together, in fact.  However, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be what a really affectionate mother requires.  Do you smoke?\n\nJack.  Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.\n\nLady Bracknell.  I am glad to hear it.  A man should always have an occupation of some kind.  There are far too many idle men in London as it is.  How old are you?\n\nJack.  Twenty-nine.\n\nLady Bracknell.  A very good age to be married at.  I have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing.  Which do you know?\n\nJack.  [After some hesitation.]  I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLady Bracknell.  I am pleased to hear it.  I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance.  Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.  The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound.  Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever.  If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.  What is your income?\n\nJack.  Between seven and eight thousand a year.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Makes a note in her book.]  In land, or in investments?\n\nJack.  In investments, chiefly.\n\nLady Bracknell.  That is satisfactory.  What between the duties expected of one during one\u2019s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one\u2019s death, land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.  It gives one position, and prevents one from keeping it up.  That\u2019s all that can be said about land.\n\nJack.  I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about fifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don\u2019t depend on that for my real income.  In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the only people who make anything out of it.\n\nLady Bracknell.  A country house!  How many bedrooms?  Well, that point can be cleared up afterwards.  You have a town house, I hope?  A girl with a simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside in the country.\n\nJack.  Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to Lady Bloxham.  Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six months\u2019 notice.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Lady Bloxham?  I don\u2019t know her.\n\nJack.  Oh, she goes about very little.  She is a lady considerably advanced in years.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of character.  What number in Belgrave Square?\n\nJack.  149.\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Shaking her head.]  The unfashionable side.  I thought there was something.  However, that could easily be altered.\n\nJack.  Do you mean the fashion, or the side?\n\nLady Bracknell.  [Sternly.]  Both, if necessary, I presume.  What are your politics?\n\nJack.  Well, I am afraid I really have none.  I am a Liberal Unionist.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Oh, they count as Tories.  They dine with us.  Or come in the evening, at any rate.  Now to minor matters.  Are your parents living?\n\nJack.  I have lost both my parents.\n\nLady Bracknell.  To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.  Who was your father?  He was evidently a man of some wealth.  Was he born in what the Radical papers call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the aristocracy?\n\nJack.  I am afraid I really don\u2019t know.  The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents.  It would be nearer the truth to say that my parents seem to have lost me . . . I don\u2019t actually know who I am by birth.  I was . . . well, I was found.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Found!\n\nJack.  The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and kindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because he happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time.  Worthing is a place in Sussex.  It is a seaside resort.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for this seaside resort find you?\n\nJack.  [Gravely.]  In a hand-bag.\n\nLady Bracknell.  A hand-bag?\n\nJack.  [Very seriously.]  Yes, Lady Bracknell.  I was in a hand-bag\u2014a somewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it\u2014an ordinary hand-bag in fact.\n\nLady Bracknell.  In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this ordinary hand-bag?\n\nJack.  In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.  It was given to him in mistake for his own.\n\nLady Bracknell.  The cloak-room at Victoria Station?\n\nJack.  Yes.  The Brighton line.\n\nLady Bracknell.  The line is immaterial.  Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me.  To be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.  And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to?  As for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a railway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion\u2014has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now\u2014but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good society.\n\nJack.  May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?  I need hardly say I would do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen\u2019s happiness.\n\nLady Bracknell.  I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire some relations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.\n\nJack.  Well, I don\u2019t see how I could possibly manage to do that.  I can produce the hand-bag at any moment.  It is in my dressing-room at home.  I really think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.\n\nLady Bracknell.  Me, sir!  What has it to do with me?  You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter\u2014a girl brought up with the utmost care\u2014to marry into a cloak-room, and form an alliance with a parcel?  Good morning, Mr. Worthing!\n\n[Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation.]\n\nJack.  Good morning!  [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the Wedding March.  Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.]  For goodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t play that ghastly tune, Algy.  How idiotic you are!\n\n[The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily.]\n\nAlgernon.  Didn\u2019t it go off all right, old boy?  You don\u2019t mean to say Gwendolen refused you?  I know it is a way she has.  She is always refusing people.  I think it is most ill-natured of her.\n\nJack.  Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet.  As far as she is concerned, we are engaged.  Her mother is perfectly unbearable.  Never met such a Gorgon . . . I don\u2019t really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am quite sure that Lady Bracknell is one.  In any case, she is a monster, without being a myth, which is rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon, Algy, I suppose I shouldn\u2019t talk about your own aunt in that way before you.\n\nAlgernon.  My dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused.  It is the only thing that makes me put up with them at all.  Relations are simply a tedious pack of people, who haven\u2019t got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.\n\nJack.  Oh, that is nonsense!\n\nAlgernon.  It isn\u2019t!\n\nJack.  Well, I won\u2019t argue about the matter.  You always want to argue about things.\n\nAlgernon.  That is exactly what things were originally made for.\n\nJack.  Upon my word, if I thought that, I\u2019d shoot myself . . . [A pause.]  You don\u2019t think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother in about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?\n\nAlgernon.  All women become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.  No man does.  That\u2019s his.\n\nJack.  Is that clever?\n\nAlgernon.  It is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in civilised life should be.\n\nJack.  I am sick to death of cleverness.  Everybody is clever nowadays.  You can\u2019t go anywhere without meeting clever people.  The thing has become an absolute public nuisance.  I wish to goodness we had a few fools left.\n\nAlgernon.  We have.\n\nJack.  I should extremely like to meet them.  What do they talk about?\n\nAlgernon.  The fools?  Oh! about the clever people, of course.\n\nJack.  What fools!\n\nAlgernon.  By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?\n\nJack.  [In a very patronising manner.]  My dear fellow, the truth isn\u2019t quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.  What extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!\n\nAlgernon.  The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.\n\nJack.  Oh, that is nonsense.\n\nAlgernon.  What about your brother?  What about the profligate Ernest?\n\nJack.  Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him.  I\u2019ll say he died in Paris of apoplexy.  Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite suddenly, don\u2019t they?\n\nAlgernon.  Yes, but it\u2019s hereditary, my dear fellow.  It\u2019s a sort of thing that runs in families.  You had much better say a severe chill.\n\nJack.  You are sure a severe chill isn\u2019t hereditary, or anything of that kind?\n\nAlgernon.  Of course it isn\u2019t!\n\nJack.  Very well, then.  My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly, in Paris, by a severe chill.  That gets rid of him.\n\nAlgernon.  But I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too much interested in your poor brother Ernest?  Won\u2019t she feel his loss a good deal?\n\nJack.  Oh, that is all right.  Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad to say.  She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no attention at all to her lessons.\n\nAlgernon.  I would rather like to see Cecily.\n\nJack.  I will take very good care you never do.  She is excessively pretty, and she is only just eighteen.\n\nAlgernon.  Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward who is only just eighteen?\n\nJack.  Oh! one doesn\u2019t blurt these things out to people.  Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends.  I\u2019ll bet you anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other sister.\n\nAlgernon.  Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first.  Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at Willis\u2019s, we really must go and dress.  Do you know it is nearly seven?\n\nJack.  [Irritably.]  Oh!  It always is nearly seven.\n\nAlgernon.  Well, I\u2019m hungry.\n\nJack.  I never knew you when you weren\u2019t . . .\n\nAlgernon.  What shall we do after dinner?  Go to a theatre?\n\nJack.  Oh no!  I loathe listening.\n\nAlgernon.  Well, let us go to the Club?\n\nJack.  Oh, no!  I hate talking.\n\nAlgernon.  Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?\n\nJack.  Oh, no!  I can\u2019t bear looking at things.  It is so silly.\n\nAlgernon.  Well, what shall we do?\n\nJack.  Nothing!\n\nAlgernon.  It is awfully hard work doing nothing.  However, I don\u2019t mind hard work where there is no definite object of any kind.\n\n[Enter Lane.]\n\nLane.  Miss Fairfax.\n\n[Enter Gwendolen.  Lane goes out.]\n\nAlgernon.  Gwendolen, upon my word!\n\nGwendolen.  Algy, kindly turn your back.  I have something very particular to say to Mr. Worthing.\n\nAlgernon.  Really, Gwendolen, I don\u2019t think I can allow this at all.\n\nGwendolen.  Algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life.  You are not quite old enough to do that.  [Algernon retires to the fireplace.]\n\nJack.  My own darling!\n\nGwendolen.  Ernest, we may never be married.  From the expression on mamma\u2019s face I fear we never shall.  Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them.  The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out.  Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age of three.  But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife, and I may marry some one else, and marry often, nothing that she can possibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.\n\nJack.  Dear Gwendolen!\n\nGwendolen.  The story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma, with unpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my nature.  Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination.  The simplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to me.  Your town address at the Albany I have.  What is your address in the country?\n\nJack.  The Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.\n\n[Algernon, who has been carefully listening, smiles to himself, and writes the address on his shirt-cuff.  Then picks up the Railway Guide.]\n\nGwendolen.  There is a good postal service, I suppose?  It may be necessary to do something desperate.  That of course will require serious consideration.  I will communicate with you daily.\n\nJack.  My own one!\n\nGwendolen.  How long do you remain in town?\n\nJack.  Till Monday.\n\nGwendolen.  Good!  Algy, you may turn round now.\n\nAlgernon.  Thanks, I\u2019ve turned round already.\n\nGwendolen.  You may also ring the bell.\n\nJack.  You will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?\n\nGwendolen.  Certainly.\n\nJack.  [To Lane, who now enters.]  I will see Miss Fairfax out.\n\nLane.  Yes, sir.  [Jack and Gwendolen go off.]\n\n[Lane presents several letters on a salver to Algernon.  It is to be surmised that they are bills, as Algernon, after looking at the envelopes, tears them up.]\n\nAlgernon.  A glass of sherry, Lane.\n\nLane.  Yes, sir.\n\nAlgernon.  To-morrow, Lane, I\u2019m going Bunburying.\n\nLane.  Yes, sir.\n\nAlgernon.  I shall probably not be back till Monday.  You can put up my dress clothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits . . .\n\nLane.  Yes, sir.  [Handing sherry.]\n\nAlgernon.  I hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.\n\nLane.  It never is, sir.\n\nAlgernon.  Lane, you\u2019re a perfect pessimist.\n\nLane.  I do my best to give satisfaction, sir.\n\n[Enter Jack.  Lane goes off.]\n\nJack.  There\u2019s a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever cared for in my life.  [Algernon is laughing immoderately.]  What on earth are you so amused at?\n\nAlgernon.  Oh, I\u2019m a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that is all.\n\nJack.  If you don\u2019t take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into a serious scrape some day.\n\nAlgernon.  I love scrapes.  They are the only things that are never serious.\n\nJack.  Oh, that\u2019s nonsense, Algy.  You never talk anything but nonsense.\n\nAlgernon.  Nobody ever does.\n\n[Jack looks indignantly at him, and leaves the room.  Algernon lights a cigarette, reads his shirt-cuff, and smiles.]\n\nACT DROP\nSECOND ACT\nSCENE\n\nGarden at the Manor House.  A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the house.  The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses.  Time of year, July.  Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a large yew-tree.\n\n[Miss Prism discovered seated at the table.  Cecily is at the back watering flowers.]\n\nMiss Prism.  [Calling.]  Cecily, Cecily!  Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather Moulton\u2019s duty than yours?  Especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you.  Your German grammar is on the table.  Pray open it at page fifteen.  We will repeat yesterday\u2019s lesson.\n\nCecily.  [Coming over very slowly.]  But I don\u2019t like German.  It isn\u2019t at all a becoming language.  I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after my German lesson.\n\nMiss Prism.  Child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve yourself in every way.  He laid particular stress on your German, as he was leaving for town yesterday.  Indeed, he always lays stress on your German when he is leaving for town.\n\nCecily.  Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious!  Sometimes he is so serious that I think he cannot be quite well.\n\nMiss Prism.  [Drawing herself up.]  Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his gravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so comparatively young as he is.  I know no one who has a higher sense of duty and responsibility.\n\nCecily.  I suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are together.\n\nMiss Prism.  Cecily!  I am surprised at you.  Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his life.  Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his conversation.  You must remember his constant anxiety about that unfortunate young man his brother.\n\nCecily.  I wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother, to come down here sometimes.  We might have a good influence over him, Miss Prism.  I am sure you certainly would.  You know German, and geology, and things of that kind influence a man very much.  [Cecily begins to write in her diary.]\n\nMiss Prism.  [Shaking her head.]  I do not think that even I could produce any effect on a character that according to his own brother\u2019s admission is irretrievably weak and vacillating.  Indeed I am not sure that I would desire to reclaim him.  I am not in favour of this modern mania for turning bad people into good people at a moment\u2019s notice.  As a man sows so let him reap.  You must put away your diary, Cecily.  I really don\u2019t see why you should keep a diary at all.\n\nCecily.  I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life.  If I didn\u2019t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.\n\nMiss Prism.  Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.\n\nCecily.  Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and couldn\u2019t possibly have happened.  I believe that Memory is responsible for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.\n\nMiss Prism.  Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily.  I wrote one myself in earlier days.\n\nCecily.  Did you really, Miss Prism?  How wonderfully clever you are!  I hope it did not end happily?  I don\u2019t like novels that end happily.  They depress me so much.\n\nMiss Prism.  The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily.  That is what Fiction means.\n\nCecily.  I suppose so.  But it seems very unfair.  And was your novel ever published?\n\nMiss Prism.  Alas! no.  The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned.  [Cecily starts.]  I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid.  To your work, child, these speculations are profitless.\n\nCecily.  [Smiling.]  But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.\n\nMiss Prism.  [Rising and advancing.]  Dr. Chasuble!  This is indeed a pleasure.\n\n[Enter Canon Chasuble.]\n\nChasuble.  And how are we this morning?  Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?\n\nCecily.  Miss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache.  I think it would do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the Park, Dr. Chasuble.\n\nMiss Prism.  Cecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.\n\nCecily.  No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that you had a headache.  Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my German lesson, when the Rector came in.\n\nChasuble.  I hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.\n\nCecily.  Oh, I am afraid I am.\n\nChasuble.  That is strange.  Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism\u2019s pupil, I would hang upon her lips.  [Miss Prism glares.]  I spoke metaphorically.\u2014My metaphor was drawn from bees.  Ahem!  Mr. Worthing, I suppose, has not returned from town yet?\n\nMiss Prism.  We do not expect him till Monday afternoon.\n\nChasuble.  Ah yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London.  He is not one of those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that unfortunate young man his brother seems to be.  But I must not disturb Egeria and her pupil any longer.\n\nMiss Prism.  Egeria?  My name is L\u00e6titia, Doctor.\n\nChasuble.  [Bowing.]  A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors.  I shall see you both no doubt at Evensong?\n\nMiss Prism.  I think, dear Doctor, I will have a stroll with you.  I find I have a headache after all, and a walk might do it good.\n\nChasuble.  With pleasure, Miss Prism, with pleasure.  We might go as far as the schools and back.\n\nMiss Prism.  That would be delightful.  Cecily, you will read your Political Economy in my absence.  The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee you may omit.  It is somewhat too sensational.  Even these metallic problems have their melodramatic side.\n\n[Goes down the garden with Dr. Chasuble.]\n\nCecily.  [Picks up books and throws them back on table.]  Horrid Political Economy!  Horrid Geography!  Horrid, horrid German!\n\n[Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]\n\nMerriman.  Mr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station.  He has brought his luggage with him.\n\nCecily.  [Takes the card and reads it.]  \u2018Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany, W.\u2019  Uncle Jack\u2019s brother!  Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in town?\n\nMerriman.  Yes, Miss.  He seemed very much disappointed.  I mentioned that you and Miss Prism were in the garden.  He said he was anxious to speak to you privately for a moment.\n\nCecily.  Ask Mr. Ernest Worthing to come here.  I suppose you had better talk to the housekeeper about a room for him.\n\nMerriman.  Yes, Miss.\n\n[Merriman goes off.]\n\nCecily.  I have never met any really wicked person before.  I feel rather frightened.  I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.\n\n[Enter Algernon, very gay and debonnair.]  He does!\n\nAlgernon.  [Raising his hat.]  You are my little cousin Cecily, I\u2019m sure.\n\nCecily.  You are under some strange mistake.  I am not little.  In fact, I believe I am more than usually tall for my age.  [Algernon is rather taken aback.]  But I am your cousin Cecily.  You, I see from your card, are Uncle Jack\u2019s brother, my cousin Ernest, my wicked cousin Ernest.\n\nAlgernon.  Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily.  You mustn\u2019t think that I am wicked.\n\nCecily.  If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner.  I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time.  That would be hypocrisy.\n\nAlgernon.  [Looks at her in amazement.]  Oh!  Of course I have been rather reckless.\n\nCecily.  I am glad to hear it.\n\nAlgernon.  In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own small way.\n\nCecily.  I don\u2019t think you should be so proud of that, though I am sure it must have been very pleasant.\n\nAlgernon.  It is much pleasanter being here with you.\n\nCecily.  I can\u2019t understand how you are here at all.  Uncle Jack won\u2019t be back till Monday afternoon.\n\nAlgernon.  That is a great disappointment.  I am obliged to go up by the first train on Monday morning.  I have a business appointment that I am anxious . . . to miss?\n\nCecily.  Couldn\u2019t you miss it anywhere but in London?\n\nAlgernon.  No: the appointment is in London.\n"], "title": ["The Importance of Being Earnest"], "author": ["Oscar Wilde"]}
