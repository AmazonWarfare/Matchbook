There isn't anything in them\nto eat or\"--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden\ntopic.\n\n\"So, so!\" I thought to myself, \"this is the second time he has suddenly\nstopped at the word 'drink'; what does it mean?\" Renfield seemed himself\naware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract\nmy attention from it:--\n\n\"I don't take any stock at all in such matters. 'Rats and mice and such\nsmall deer,' as Shakespeare has it, 'chicken-feed of the larder' they\nmight be called. I'm past all that sort of nonsense. You might as well\nask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop-sticks, as to try to\ninterest me about the lesser carnivora, when I know of what is before\nme.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said. \"You want big things that you can make your teeth meet\nin? How would you like to breakfast on elephant?\"\n\n\"What ridiculous nonsense you are talking!\" He was getting too wide\nawake, so I thought I would press him hard. \"I wonder,\" I said\nreflectively, \"what an elephant's soul is like!\"\n\nThe effect I desired was obtained, for he at once fell from his\nhigh-horse and became a child again.\n\n\"I don't want an elephant's soul, or any soul at all!\" he said. For a\nfew moments he sat despondently. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, with\nhis eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. \"To\nhell with you and your souls!\" he shouted. \"Why do you plague me about\nsouls? Haven't I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,\nwithout thinking of souls!\" He looked so hostile that I thought he was\nin for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant,\nhowever, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--\n\n\"Forgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so\nworried in my mind that I am apt to be irritable. If you only knew the\nproblem I have to face, and that I am working out, you would pity, and\ntolerate, and pardon me. Pray do not put me in a strait-waistcoat. I\nwant to think and I cannot think freely when my body is confined. I am\nsure you will understand!\" He had evidently self-control; so when the\nattendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew. Renfield\nwatched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable\ndignity and sweetness:--\n\n\"Dr. Seward, you have been very considerate towards me. Believe me that\nI am very, very grateful to you!\" I thought it well to leave him in this\nmood, and so I came away. There is certainly something to ponder over in\nthis man's state. Several points seem to make what the American\ninterviewer calls \"a story,\" if one could only get them in proper order.\nHere they are:--\n\nWill not mention \"drinking.\"\n\nFears the thought of being burdened with the \"soul\" of anything.\n\nHas no dread of wanting \"life\" in the future.\n\nDespises the meaner forms of life altogether, though he dreads being\nhaunted by their souls.\n\nLogically all these things point one way! he has assurance of some kind\nthat he will acquire some higher life. He dreads the consequence--the\nburden of a soul. Then it is a human life he looks to!\n\nAnd the assurance--?\n\nMerciful God! the Count has been to him, and there is some new scheme of\nterror afoot!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Later._--I went after my round to Van Helsing and told him my\nsuspicion. He grew very grave; and, after thinking the matter over for a\nwhile asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door\nwe heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time\nwhich now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that\nhe had spread out his sugar as of old; the flies, lethargic with the\nautumn, were beginning to buzz into the room. We tried to make him talk\nof the subject of our previous conversation, but he would not attend. He\nwent on with his singing, just as though we had not been present. He had\ngot a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note-book. We had to come\naway as ignorant as we went in.\n\nHis is a curious case indeed; we must watch him to-night.\n\n\n_Letter, Mitchell, Sons and Candy to Lord Godalming._\n\n_\"1 October._\n\n\"My Lord,\n\n\"We are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes. We beg, with\nregard to the desire of your Lordship, expressed by Mr. Harker on your\nbehalf, to supply the following information concerning the sale and\npurchase of No. 347, Piccadilly. The original vendors are the executors\nof the late Mr. Archibald Winter-Suffield. The purchaser is a foreign\nnobleman, Count de Ville, who effected the purchase himself paying the\npurchase money in notes 'over the counter,' if your Lordship will pardon\nus using so vulgar an expression. Beyond this we know nothing whatever\nof him.\n\n\"We are, my Lord,\n\n\"Your Lordship's humble servants,\n\n\"MITCHELL, SONS & CANDY.\"\n\n\n_Dr. Seward's Diary._\n\n_2 October._--I placed a man in the corridor last night, and told him to\nmake an accurate note of any sound he might hear from Renfield's room,\nand gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he\nwas to call me. After dinner, when we had all gathered round the fire\nin the study--Mrs. Harker having gone to bed--we discussed the attempts\nand discoveries of the day. Harker was the only one who had any result,\nand we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one.\n\nBefore going to bed I went round to the patient's room and looked in\nthrough the observation trap. He was sleeping soundly, and his heart\nrose and fell with regular respiration.\n\nThis morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight\nhe was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly. I asked him\nif that was all; he replied that it was all he heard. There was\nsomething about his manner so suspicious that I asked him point blank if\nhe had been asleep. He denied sleep, but admitted to having \"dozed\" for\na while. It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are\nwatched.\n\nTo-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are\nlooking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have\nhorses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we\nseek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported\nearth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his\nweakest, and without a refuge to fly to. Van Helsing is off to the\nBritish Museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine. The old\nphysicians took account of things which their followers do not accept,\nand the Professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be\nuseful to us later.\n\nI sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in\nstrait-waistcoats.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Later._--We have met again. We seem at last to be on the track, and our\nwork of to-morrow may be the beginning of the end. I wonder if\nRenfield's quiet has anything to do with this. His moods have so\nfollowed the doings of the Count, that the coming destruction of the\nmonster may be carried to him in some subtle way. If we could only get\nsome hint as to what passed in his mind, between the time of my argument\nwith him to-day and his resumption of fly-catching, it might afford us a\nvaluable clue. He is now seemingly quiet for a spell.... Is he?---- That\nwild yell seemed to come from his room....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe attendant came bursting into my room and told me that Renfield had\nsomehow met with some accident. He had heard him yell; and when he went\nto him found him lying on his face on the floor, all covered with blood.\nI must go at once....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nDR. SEWARD'S DIARY\n\n\n_3 October._--Let me put down with exactness all that happened, as well\nas I can remember it, since last I made an entry. Not a detail that I\ncan recall must be forgotten; in all calmness I must proceed.\n\nWhen I came to Renfield's room I found him lying on the floor on his\nleft side in a glittering pool of blood. When I went to move him, it\nbecame at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries;\nthere seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body\nwhich marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see\nthat it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against the\nfloor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood\noriginated. The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as\nwe turned him over:--\n\n\"I think, sir, his back is broken. See, both his right arm and leg and\nthe whole side of his face are paralysed.\" How such a thing could have\nhappened puzzled the attendant beyond measure. He seemed quite\nbewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--\n\n\"I can't understand the two things. He could mark his face like that by\nbeating his own head on the floor. I saw a young woman do it once at the\nEversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her. And I suppose he\nmight have broke his neck by falling out of bed, if he got in an awkward\nkink. But for the life of me I can't imagine how the two things\noccurred. If his back was broke, he couldn't beat his head; and if his\nface was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be marks of\nit.\" I said to him:--\n\n\"Go to Dr. Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once. I want\nhim without an instant's delay.\" The man ran off, and within a few\nminutes the Professor, in his dressing gown and slippers, appeared. When\nhe saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment, and\nthen turned to me. I think he recognised my thought in my eyes, for he\nsaid very quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--\n\n\"Ah, a sad accident! He will need very careful watching, and much\nattention. I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.\nIf you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.\"\n\nThe patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that\nhe had suffered some terrible injury. Van Helsing returned with\nextraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case. He had\nevidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he\nlooked at the patient, he whispered to me:--\n\n\"Send the attendant away. We must be alone with him when he becomes\nconscious, after the operation.\" So I said:--\n\n\"I think that will do now, Simmons. We have done all that we can at\npresent. You had better go your round, and Dr. Van Helsing will operate.\nLet me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.\"\n\nThe man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.\nThe wounds of the face was superficial; the real injury was a depressed\nfracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area. The\nProfessor thought a moment and said:--\n\n\"We must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far\nas can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of\nhis injury. The whole motor area seems affected. The suffusion of the\nbrain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be\ntoo late.\" As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door. I\nwent over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and\nQuincey in pajamas and slippers: the former spoke:--\n\n\"I heard your man call up Dr. Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.\nSo I woke Quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep. Things\nare moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us\nthese times. I've been thinking that to-morrow night will not see things\nas they have been. We'll have to look back--and forward a little more\nthan we have done. May we come in?\" I nodded, and held the door open\ntill they had entered; then I closed it again. When Quincey saw the\nattitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the\nfloor, he said softly:--\n\n\"My God! what has happened to him? Poor, poor devil!\" I told him\nbriefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after\nthe operation--for a short time, at all events. He went at once and sat\ndown on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched\nin patience.\n\n\"We shall wait,\" said Van Helsing, \"just long enough to fix the best\nspot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove\nthe blood clot; for it is evident that the h\u00e6morrhage is increasing.\"\n\nThe minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness. I had a\nhorrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing's face I gathered\nthat he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come. I dreaded\nthe words that Renfield might speak. I was positively afraid to think;\nbut the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read of men\nwho have heard the death-watch. The poor man's breathing came in\nuncertain gasps. Each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes\nand speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath, and he\nwould relapse into a more fixed insensibility. Inured as I was to sick\nbeds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me. I could almost\nhear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through my\ntemples sounded like blows from a hammer. The silence finally became\nagonising. I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from\ntheir flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal\ntorture. There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead\nsome dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect\nit.\n\nAt last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was\nsinking fast; he might die at any moment. I looked up at the Professor\nand caught his eyes fixed on mine. His face was sternly set as he\nspoke:--\n\n\"There is no time to lose. His words may be worth many lives; I have\nbeen thinking so, as I stood here. It may be there is a soul at stake!\nWe shall operate just above the ear.\"\n\nWithout another word he made the operation. For a few moments the\nbreathing continued to be stertorous. Then there came a breath so\nprolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.\nSuddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless stare.\nThis was continued for a few moments; then it softened into a glad\nsurprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief. He moved\nconvulsively, and as he did so, said:--\n\n\"I'll be quiet, Doctor. Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat. I\nhave had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot\nmove. What's wrong with my face? it feels all swollen, and it smarts\ndreadfully.\" He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his\neyes seemed to grow glassy again so I gently put it back. Then Van\nHelsing said in a quiet grave tone:--\n\n\"Tell us your dream, Mr. Renfield.\" As he heard the voice his face\nbrightened, through its mutilation, and he said:--\n\n\"That is Dr. Van Helsing. How good it is of you to be here. Give me some\nwater, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you. I dreamed\"--he\nstopped and seemed fainting, I called quietly to Quincey--\"The\nbrandy--it is in my study--quick!\" He flew and returned with a glass,\nthe decanter of brandy and a carafe of water. We moistened the parched\nlips, and the patient quickly revived. It seemed, however, that his poor\ninjured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite\nconscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I\nshall never forget, and said:--\n\n\"I must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.\"\nThen his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two\nfigures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--\n\n\"If I were not sure already, I would know from them.\" For an instant his\neyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he were\nbringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,\nhurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--\n\n\"Quick, Doctor, quick. I am dying! I feel that I have but a few minutes;\nand then I must go back to death--or worse! Wet my lips with brandy\nagain. I have something that I must say before I die; or before my poor\ncrushed brain dies anyhow. Thank you! It was that night after you left\nme, when I implored you to let me go away. I couldn't speak then, for I\nfelt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that way, as\nI am now. I was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left\nme; it seemed hours. Then there came a sudden peace to me. My brain\nseemed to become cool again, and I realised where I was. I heard the\ndogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!\" As he spoke, Van\nHelsing's eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine and\ngripped it hard. He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded slightly\nand said: \"Go on,\" in a low voice. Renfield proceeded:--\n\n\"He came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;\nbut he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a\nman's when angry. He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white\nteeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt\nof trees, to where the dogs were barking. I wouldn't ask him to come in\nat first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.\nThen he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.\" He\nwas interrupted by a word from the Professor:--\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the\nsun was shining. Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their\nwings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their\nbacks.\" Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--\n\n\"The _Acherontia Aitetropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the\n'Death's-head Moth'?\" The patient went on without stopping.\n\n\"Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands,\nmillions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats\ntoo. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely\nbuzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do.\nThen the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He\nbeckoned me to the window. I got up and looked out, and He raised his\nhands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass\nspread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and\nthen He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there\nwere thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His, only\nsmaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he\nseemed to be saying: 'All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more\nand greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship\nme!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close\nover my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening\nthe sash and saying to Him: 'Come in, Lord and Master!' The rats were\nall gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was only\nopen an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through\nthe tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and\nsplendour.\"\n\nHis voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and\nhe continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in\nthe interval for his story was further advanced. I was about to call him\nback to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: \"Let him go on. Do\nnot interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all\nif once he lost the thread of his thought.\" He proceeded:--\n\n\"All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not\neven a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.\nWhen he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even\nknock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked\nout of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he\nowned the whole place, and I was no one. He didn't even smell the same\nas he went by me. I couldn't hold him. I thought that, somehow, Mrs.\nHarker had come into the room.\"\n\nThe two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind\nhim so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.\nThey were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his face,\nhowever, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without\nnoticing:--\n\n\"When Mrs. Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn't the same;\nit was like tea after the teapot had been watered.\" Here we all moved,\nbut no one said a word; he went on:--\n\n\"I didn't know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn't look the\nsame. I don't care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood\nin them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn't think of it\nat the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad\nto know that He had been taking the life out of her.\" I could feel that\nthe rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. \"So when\nHe came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I\ngrabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and\nas I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.\nAy, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle\nwith me. I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn't\nmean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes. They burned\ninto me, and my strength became like water. He slipped through it, and\nwhen I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down. There\nwas a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed\nto steal away under the door.\" His voice was becoming fainter and his\nbreath more stertorous. Van Helsing stood up instinctively.\n\n\"We know the worst now,\" he said. \"He is here, and we know his purpose.\nIt may not be too late. Let us be armed--the same as we were the other\nnight, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.\" There was no\nneed to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in\ncommon. We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we\nhad when we entered the Count's house. The Professor had his ready, and\nas we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--\n\n\"They never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is\nover. Be wise also, my friends. It is no common enemy that we deal with.\nAlas! alas! that that dear Madam Mina should suffer!\" He stopped; his\nvoice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in\nmy own heart.\n\nOutside the Harkers' door we paused. Art and Quincey held back, and the\nlatter said:--\n\n\"Should we disturb her?\"\n\n\"We must,\" said Van Helsing grimly. \"If the door be locked, I shall\nbreak it in.\"\n\n\"May it not frighten her terribly? It is unusual to break into a lady's\nroom!\"\n\nVan Helsing said solemnly, \"You are always right; but this is life and\ndeath. All chambers are alike to the doctor; and even were they not they\nare all as one to me to-night. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if\nthe door does not open, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you\ntoo, my friends. Now!\"\n\nHe turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield. We threw\nourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell\nheadlong into the room. The Professor did actually fall, and I saw\nacross him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees. What I saw\nappalled me. I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,\nand my heart seemed to stand still.\n\nThe moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room\nwas light enough to see. On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan\nHarker, his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.\nKneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad\nfigure of his wife. By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.\nHis face was turned from us, but the instant we saw we all recognised\nthe Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead. With his left\nhand he held both Mrs. Harker's hands, keeping them away with her arms\nat full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,\nforcing her face down on his bosom. Her white nightdress was smeared\nwith blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare breast which\nwas shown by his torn-open dress. The attitude of the two had a terrible\nresemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to\ncompel it to drink. As we burst into the room, the Count turned his\nface, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap\ninto it. His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils\nof the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the\nwhite sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,\nchamped together like those of a wild beast. With a wrench, which threw\nhis victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned\nand sprang at us. But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,\nand was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred\nWafer. The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside\nthe tomb, and cowered back. Further and further back he cowered, as we,\nlifting our crucifixes, advanced. The moonlight suddenly failed, as a\ngreat black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up\nunder Quincey's match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour. This, as we\nlooked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting\nopen, had swung back to its old position. Van Helsing, Art, and I moved\nforward to Mrs. Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with\nit had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it\nseems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a\nfew seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was\nghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared\nher lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of\nblood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her\npoor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the\nCount's terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail\nwhich made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an\nendless grief. Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently\nover her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant\ndespairingly, ran out of the room. Van Helsing whispered to me:--\n\n\"Jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce. We can\ndo nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she recovers\nherself; I must wake him!\" He dipped the end of a towel in cold water\nand with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all the while\nholding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was\nheart-breaking to hear. I raised the blind, and looked out of the\nwindow. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey\nMorris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great\nyew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the\ninstant I heard Harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial\nconsciousness, and turned to the bed. On his face, as there might well\nbe, was a look of wild amazement. He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and\nthen full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he\nstarted up. His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to\nhim with her arms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly,\nhowever, she drew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held\nher hands before her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.\n\n\"In God's name what does this mean?\" Harker cried out. \"Dr. Seward, Dr.\nVan Helsing, what is it? What has happened? What is wrong? Mina, dear,\nwhat is it? What does that blood mean? My God, my God! has it come to\nthis!\" and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly\ntogether. \"Good God help us! help her! oh, help her!\" With a quick\nmovement he jumped from bed, and began to pull on his clothes,--all the\nman in him awake at the need for instant exertion. \"What has happened?\nTell me all about it!\" he cried without pausing. \"Dr. Van Helsing, you\nlove Mina, I know. Oh, do something to save her. It cannot have gone too\nfar yet. Guard her while I look for _him_!\" His wife, through her terror\nand horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him: instantly\nforgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried out:--\n\n\"No! no! Jonathan, you must not leave me. I have suffered enough\nto-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you. You must stay\nwith me. Stay with these friends who will watch over you!\" Her\nexpression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she\npulled him down sitting on the bed side, and clung to him fiercely.\n\nVan Helsing and I tried to calm them both. The Professor held up his\nlittle golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--\n\n\"Do not fear, my dear. We are here; and whilst this is close to you no\nfoul thing can approach. You are safe for to-night; and we must be calm\nand take counsel together.\" She shuddered and was silent, holding down\nher head on her husband's breast. When she raised it, his white\nnight-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where\nthe thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops. The instant she\nsaw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking\nsobs:--\n\n\"Unclean, unclean! I must touch him or kiss him no more. Oh, that it\nshould be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have\nmost cause to fear.\" To this he spoke out resolutely:--\n\n\"Nonsense, Mina. It is a shame to me to hear such a word. I would not\nhear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you. May God judge me by my\ndeserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,\nif by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!\" He put out\nhis arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there\nsobbing. He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked\ndamply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel. After a\nwhile her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said to\nme, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous\npower to the utmost:--\n\n\"And now, Dr. Seward, tell me all about it. Too well I know the broad\nfact; tell me all that has been.\" I told him exactly what had happened,\nand he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched\nand his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had\nheld his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to\nthe open wound in his breast. It interested me, even at that moment, to\nsee, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over\nthe bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled\nhair. Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the door.\nThey entered in obedience to our summons. Van Helsing looked at me\nquestioningly. I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of\ntheir coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband\nand wife from each other and from themselves; so on nodding acquiescence\nto him he asked them what they had seen or done. To which Lord Godalming\nanswered:--\n\n\"I could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms. I\nlooked in the study but, though he had been there, he had gone. He had,\nhowever----\" He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on\nthe bed. Van Helsing said gravely:--\n\n\"Go on, friend Arthur. We want here no more concealments. Our hope now\nis in knowing all. Tell freely!\" So Art went on:--\n\n\"He had been there, and though it could only have been for a few\nseconds, he made rare hay of the place. All the manuscript had been\nburned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes; the\ncylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the wax\nhad helped the flames.\" Here I interrupted. \"Thank God there is the\nother copy in the safe!\" His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he\nwent on: \"I ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him. I looked\ninto Renfield's room; but there was no trace there except----!\" Again he\npaused. \"Go on,\" said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head and\nmoistening his lips with his tongue, added: \"except that the poor fellow\nis dead.\" Mrs. Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of\nus she said solemnly:--\n\n\"God's will be done!\" I could not but feel that Art was keeping back\nsomething; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.\nVan Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--\n\n\"And you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?\"\n\n\"A little,\" he answered. \"It may be much eventually, but at present I\ncan't say. I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would\ngo when he left the house. I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from\nRenfield's window, and flap westward. I expected to see him in some\nshape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair. He\nwill not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the\ndawn is close. We must work to-morrow!\"\n\nHe said the latter words through his shut teeth. For a space of perhaps\na couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could\nhear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his\nhand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker's head:--\n\n\"And now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what\nhappened. God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is\nneed that we know all. For now more than ever has all work to be done\nquick and sharp, and in deadly earnest. The day is close to us that must\nend all, if it may be so; and now is the chance that we may live and\nlearn.\"\n\nThe poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves\nas she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and\nlower still on his breast. Then she raised her head proudly, and held\nout one hand to Van Helsing who took it in his, and, after stooping and\nkissing it reverently, held it fast. The other hand was locked in that\nof her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.\nAfter a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she\nbegan:--\n\n\"I took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a\nlong time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads\nof horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them\nconnected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.\"\nHer husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said\nlovingly: \"Do not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me\nthrough the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it is to me\nto tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I\nneed your help. Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine to its work\nwith my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to\nsleep. Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no\nmore. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when\nnext I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I\nhad before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this; you will find\nit in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague\nterror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence.\nI turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it\nseemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I\ntried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I\nlooked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside\nthe bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist\nhad turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a\ntall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of\nthe others. The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light\nfell in a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white\nteeth showing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the\nsunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the\nred scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant\nmy heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was\nparalysed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper,\npointing as he spoke to Jonathan:--\n\n\"'Silence! If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out\nbefore your very eyes.' I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or\nsay anything. With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder\nand, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did\nso, 'First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions. You may as well\nbe quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have\nappeased my thirst!' I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not\nwant to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that\nsuch is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity\nme! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!\" Her husband groaned\nagain. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if\nhe were the injured one, and went on:--\n\n\"I felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long\nthis horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time\nmust have passed before he took his foul, awful, sneering mouth away. I\nsaw it drip with the fresh blood!\" The remembrance seemed for a while to\noverpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her\nhusband's sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and\nwent on:--\n\n\"Then he spoke to me mockingly, 'And so you, like the others, would play\nyour brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and\nfrustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already,\nand will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They\nshould have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they\nplayed wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and intrigued\nfor them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they were\nborn--I was countermining them. And you, their best beloved one, are now\nto me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful\nwine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my\nhelper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall\nminister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you\nhave done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my\ncall. When my brain says \"Come!\" to you, you shall cross land or sea to\ndo my bidding; and to that end this!' With that he pulled open his\nshirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast. When\nthe blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding\nthem tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to\nthe wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the---- Oh\nmy God! my God! what have I done? What have I done to deserve such a\nfate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my\ndays. God pity me! Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;\nand in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!\" Then she began to rub her\nlips as though to cleanse them from pollution.\n\nAs she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,\nand everything became more and more clear. Harker was still and quiet;\nbut over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look\nwhich deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first\nred streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out\nagainst the whitening hair.\n\nWe have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy\npair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.\n\nOf this I am sure: the sun rises to-day on no more miserable house in\nall the great round of its daily course.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nJONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL\n\n\n_3 October._--As I must do something or go mad, I write this diary. It\nis now six o'clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and\ntake something to eat; for Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward are agreed\nthat if we do not eat we cannot work our best. Our best will be, God\nknows, required to-day. I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare\nnot stop to think. All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end\nthe little things may teach us most. The teaching, big or little, could\nnot have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day. However,\nwe must trust and hope. Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears\nrunning down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our\nfaith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us\nup to the end. The end! oh my God! what end?... To work! To work!\n\nWhen Dr. Van Helsing and Dr. Seward had come back from seeing poor\nRenfield, we went gravely into what was to be done. First, Dr. Seward\ntold us that when he and Dr. Van Helsing had gone down to the room below\nthey had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap. His face was\nall bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.\n\nDr. Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had\nheard anything. He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to\nhalf dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield\nhad called out loudly several times, \"God! God! God!\" after that there\nwas a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying\non the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him. Van Helsing\nasked if he had heard \"voices\" or \"a voice,\" and he said he could not\nsay; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as\nthere was no one in the room it could have been only one. He could swear\nto it, if required, that the word \"God\" was spoken by the patient. Dr.\nSeward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into\nthe matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it\nwould never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it. As\nit was, he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a\ncertificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed. In case the\ncoroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily\nto the same result.\n\nWhen the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next\nstep, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full\nconfidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be\nkept from her. She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful\nto see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of\ndespair. \"There must be no concealment,\" she said, \"Alas! we have had\ntoo much already. And besides there is nothing in all the world that can\ngive me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!\nWhatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!\"\nVan Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly\nbut quietly:--\n\n\"But dear Madam Mina, are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for\nothers from yourself, after what has happened?\" Her face grew set in its\nlines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she\nanswered:--\n\n\"Ah no! for my mind is made up!\"\n\n\"To what?\" he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in\nour own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant. Her answer\ncame with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--\n\n\"Because if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of\nharm to any that I love, I shall die!\"\n\n\"You would not kill yourself?\" he asked, hoarsely.\n\n\"I would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such a\npain, and so desperate an effort!\" She looked at him meaningly as she\nspoke. He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and\nput his hand on her head as he said solemnly:\n\n\"My child, there is such an one if it were for your good. For myself I\ncould hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for you,\neven at this moment if it were best. Nay, were it safe! But my\nchild----\" For a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his\nthroat; he gulped it down and went on:--\n\n\"There are here some who would stand between you and death. You must not\ndie. You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own. Until\nthe other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must not\ndie; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would make\nyou even as he is. No, you must live! You must struggle and strive to\nlive, though death would seem a boon unspeakable. You must fight Death\nhimself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day, or the\nnight; in safety or in peril! On your living soul I charge you that you\ndo not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be past.\" The\npoor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a\nquicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide. We were all\nsilent; we could do nothing. At length she grew more calm and turning to\nhim said, sweetly, but oh! so sorrowfully, as she held out her hand:--\n\n\"I promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall\nstrive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror may\nhave passed away from me.\" She was so good and brave that we all felt\nthat our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her, and we\nbegan to discuss what we were to do. I told her that she was to have all\nthe papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we\nmight hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she had done before.\nShe was pleased with the prospect of anything to do--if \"pleased\" could\nbe used in connection with so grim an interest.\n\nAs usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was\nprepared with an exact ordering of our work.\n\n\"It is perhaps well,\" he said, \"that at our meeting after our visit to\nCarfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that lay\nthere. Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose, and\nwould doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an\neffort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our\nintentions. Nay, more, in all probability, he does not know that such a\npower exists to us as can sterilise his lairs, so that he cannot use\nthem as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as\nto their disposition that, when we have examined the house in\nPiccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours;\nand in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning\nguards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must\nretain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations\nof his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear\nthrough cracks or chinks or crannies. If he go through a doorway, he\nmust open the door like a mortal. And so we have this day to hunt out\nall his lairs and sterilise them. So we shall, if we have not yet catch\nhim and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching\nand the destroying shall be, in time, sure.\" Here I started up for I\ncould not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so\npreciously laden with Mina's life and happiness were flying from us,\nsince whilst we talked action was impossible. But Van Helsing held up\nhis hand warningly. \"Nay, friend Jonathan,\" he said, \"in this, the\nquickest way home is the longest way, so your proverb say. We shall all\nact and act with desperate quick, when the time has come. But think, in\nall probable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.\nThe Count may have many houses which he has bought. Of them he will have\ndeeds of purchase, keys and other things. He will have paper that he\nwrite on; he will have his book of cheques. There are many belongings\nthat he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,\nwhere he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the\nvery vast of the traffic there is none to notice. We shall go there and\nsearch that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our\nfriend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt 'stop the earths' and so we\nrun down our old fox--so? is it not?\"\n\n\"Then let us come at once,\" I cried, \"we are wasting the precious,\nprecious time!\" The Professor did not move, but simply said:--\n\n\"And how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?\"\n\n\"Any way!\" I cried. \"We shall break in if need be.\"\n\n\"And your police; where will they be, and what will they say?\"\n\nI was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good\nreason for it. So I said, as quietly as I could:--\n\n\"Don't wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am\nin.\"\n\n\"Ah, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to\nyour anguish. But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at\nmovement. Then will come our time. I have thought and thought, and it\nseems to me that the simplest way is the best of all. Now we wish to get\ninto the house, but we have no key; is it not so?\" I nodded.\n\n\"Now suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and could\nnot still get it; and think there was to you no conscience of the\nhousebreaker, what would you do?\"\n\n\"I should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the\nlock for me.\"\n\n\"And your police, they would interfere, would they not?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! not if they knew the man was properly employed.\"\n\n\"Then,\" he looked at me as keenly as he spoke, \"all that is in doubt is\nthe conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as to\nwhether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your\npolice must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in reading\nthe heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my\nfriend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this"], "title": ["Dracula"], "author": ["Bram Stoker"]}
