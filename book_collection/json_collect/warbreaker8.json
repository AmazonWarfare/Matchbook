Denth finally turned, eyeing Vivenna, and nodded.\n\nShe pulled up her shawl\u2014not the matronly one she\u2019d brought from Idris, but a silken, gossamer one that Denth had found for her. She met Fob\u2019s eyes, then changed her hair to a deep red. With the shawl up, only those at the table and watching closely would be able to see the change.\n\nHe froze. \u201cDo that again,\u201d he said.\n\nShe changed it to blond.\n\nFob sat back, letting his mussel fall free of its shell. It splatted against the table near the one Tonk Fah had dropped. \u201cThe queen?\u201d he asked with shock.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cHer sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Fob asked.\n\nDenth smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s here to organize a resistance against the Returned gods and to prepare Idrian interests here in T\u2019Telir for the coming war.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think that old royal up in the highlands would send his daughter for nothing?\u201d Tonk Fah said. \u201cWar. It\u2019s the only thing that would call for such desperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour sister,\u201d Fob said, eyeing Vivenna. \u201cThey sent the younger one into the court. Why?\u201d \u201cThe king\u2019s plans are his own, Fob,\u201d Denth said.\n\nFob looked thoughtful. Finally, he flipped the fallen mussel onto the plate of shells and reached for a fresh one. \u201cI knew there was more behind that girl\u2019s arrival than simple chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll harvest?\u201d Denth asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Fob said.\n\nDenth nodded. \u201cGood enough, I guess.\u201d\n\nHe nodded to Vivenna and Tonk Fah, and the three of them left Fob eating his shellfish. Vivenna settled the tab\u2014which was even higher than she\u2019d feared\u2014and then they joined Parlin, Jewels, and Clod the Lifeless waiting outside. The group moved away from the restaurant, pushing through the crowd easily, if only because of the massive Lifeless that walked before them.\n\n\u201cWhere now?\u201d Vivenna asked.\n\nDenth eyed her. \u201cNot tired even a little?\u201d\n\nVivenna didn\u2019t acknowledge her sore feet or her drowsiness. \u201cWe\u2019re working for the good of my people, Denth. A little weariness is a small price.\u201d\n\nDenth shot a glance toward Tonk Fah, but the overweight mercenary had split off into the crowd toward a merchant\u2019s stand, Parlin tagging along behind. Parlin, Vivenna noticed, had gone back to wearing his\nridiculous green hat despite her disapproval. What was wrong with that man? He wasn\u2019t terribly bright, true, but he had always been levelheaded.\n\n\u201cJewels,\u201d Denth called up ahead. \u201cTake us to the Raymar place.\u201d\n\nJewels nodded, giving instructions to Clod that Vivenna couldn\u2019t hear. The group turned in another direction through the crowd.\n\n\u201cIt only responds to her?\u201d Vivenna said.\n\nDenth shrugged. \u201cIt has basic instructions to do what Tonks and I say and I\u2019ve got a security phrase I can use if I need more control.\u201d\n\nVivenna frowned. \u201cSecurity phrase?\u201d\n\nDenth eyed her. \u201cThis is a rather heretical discussion we\u2019re getting into. You sure you want to continue?\u201d\n\nVivenna ignored the amusement in his tone. \u201cI still do not like the idea of that thing being with us, particularly if I don\u2019t have any way to control it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll Awakening works by way of the Command, Princess,\u201d Denth said. \u201cYou infuse something with life, then give it an order. Lifeless are valuable because you can give them Commands after you create them, unlike regular Awakened objects, which you can only Command once in advance. Plus, Lifeless can remember a long list of complicated orders and are generally good about not misunderstanding them. They retain a bit of their humanity, I guess.\u201d\n\nVivenna shivered. That made them seem far too sentient for her liking.\n\n\u201cHowever, that means pretty much anyone can control a Lifeless,\u201d Denth said. \u201cNot just the person who created them. So we give them security phrases. A couple words you can say that will let you imprint the creature with new Commands.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the security phrase for Clod?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to ask Jewels if you can have it.\u201d\n\nVivenna opened her mouth to complain, but thought better of it. Denth obviously didn\u2019t like interfering with Jewels or her work. Vivenna would simply have to make a point of it later, once they were in a more private location. Instead, she just eyed Clod. He was dressed in simple clothing. Grey trousers and grey shirt, with a leather jerkin that had been drained of color. He carried a large blade at his waist. Not a dueling sword\u2014a more brutal, broad-bladed weapon.\n\nAll in grey, Vivenna thought. Is that because they want everyone to recognize Clod for a\n\nLifeless? Despite what Denth said about Lifeless being common, many people gave the thing a wide berth. Snakes might be common in the jungle, she thought, but that doesn\u2019t mean that people are pleased to see them.\n\nJewels chatted quietly at the Lifeless, though it never responded. It simply walked, face forward, inhuman in the steady rhythm of its steps.\n\u201cDoes she always . . . talk to it like that?\u201d Vivenna asked, shivering.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem very healthy.\u201d\n\nDenth looked troubled, though he said nothing. A few moments later, Tonk Fah and Parlin returned. Tonk Fah, Vivenna was displeased to see, had a small monkey on his shoulder. It chittered a bit, then ran behind Tonk Fah\u2019s neck, moving to the other shoulder.\n\n\u201cA new pet?\u201d Vivenna asked. \u201cWhat happened to that parrot of yours, anyway?\u201d\n\nTonk Fah looked ashamed, and Denth just shook his head. \u201cTonks isn\u2019t very good with pets.\u201d \u201cThat parrot was boring anyway,\u201d Tonk Fah said. \u201cMonkeys are much more interesting.\u201d\nVivenna shook her head. It wasn\u2019t long before they arrived at the next restaurant, one far less lavish than the previous one. Jewels, Parlin, and the Lifeless took up places outside, as usual, and Vivenna and the two male mercenaries walked in.\n\nThe meetings were becoming routine. During the last couple of weeks, they\u2019d met with at least a dozen people of varying usefulness. Some were underground leaders Denth thought might be capable of making a ruckus. Others were merchants, like Fob. All in all, Vivenna was impressed with the variety of covert ways Denth had come up with to disrupt things in T\u2019Telir.\n\nMost of the schemes did, however, require a display of Vivenna\u2019s Royal Locks as a clincher. Most people instantly grasped the importance of a royal daughter being in the city, and she was left wondering just how Lemex had intended to achieve results without such convincing proof.\n\nDenth led them to a table in the corner, and Vivenna frowned at how dirty the restaurant was. The only light came in the form of slim slatlike windows shining beams of sunlight through the ceiling, but even that was enough to show the grime. Despite her hunger, she quickly determined that she would not be eating anything at this establishment. \u201cWhy do we keep switching restaurants, anyway?\u201d she said, sitting down\u2014but only after wiping off the stool with her handkerchief.\n\n\u201cHarder to spy on us that way,\u201d Denth said. \u201cI keep warning you, Princess. This is more dangerous than it seems. Don\u2019t let the simple meetings over food throw you off. In any other city, we\u2019d be meeting in lairs, gambling parlors, or alleyways. Best to keep moving.\u201d\n\nThey settled down, and as if they hadn\u2019t just come from their second lunch of the day, Denth and Tonk Fah ordered food. Vivenna sat quietly in her chair, preparing for the meeting. Gods Feast was something of a holy day in Hallandren\u2014though, from what she\u2019d seen, the people of the pagan city had no real concept of what a \u201choly day\u201d should be. Instead of helping the monks in their fields or caring for the needy, the people took the evening off and splurged on meals\u2014as if the gods wanted them to be extravagant.\n\nAnd perhaps they did. From what she\u2019d heard, the Returned were profligate beings. It made sense for their followers to spend their \u201choly day\u201d being idle and gluttonous.\nTheir contact arrived before the food did. He walked in with two bodyguards of his own. He wore nice clothing\u2014which meant bright clothing, in T\u2019Telir\u2014but his beard was long and greasy, and he appeared to be short several teeth. He pointed, and his bodyguards pulled a second table over next to Vivenna\u2019s, then arranged three chairs by it. The man took a seat, careful to keep his distance from Denth and Tonk Fah.\n\n\u201cA little paranoid, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Denth said.\n\nThe man raised his hands. \u201cCaution never hurt a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore food for us, then,\u201d Tonk Fah said as the plate arrived. It was covered with bits of . . . something that had been battered and fried. The monkey immediately scrambled down Tonk Fah\u2019s arm and snatched a few pieces.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d the man said, \u201cyou\u2019re the infamous Denth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am. I assume you\u2019re Grable?\u201d\n\nThe man nodded.\n\nOne of the city\u2019s less reputable thieving lords, Vivenna thought. A strong ally of Vahr\u2019s rebellion. They had been waiting weeks to set up this meeting.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Denth said. \u201cWe have some interest in making certain supply carts disappear on the way to the city.\u201d He said it so openly. Vivenna glanced about, making certain no other tables were close.\n\n\u201cGrable owns this restaurant, Princess,\u201d Tonk Fah whispered. \u201cEvery second man in this room is probably a bodyguard.\u201d\n\nGreat, she thought, annoyed they hadn\u2019t told her before they entered. She glanced around again, feeling far more jumpy this time.\n\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Grable asked, bringing Vivenna\u2019s attention back to the conversation. \u201cYou want to make things disappear? Caravans of food?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult job we\u2019re asking for,\u201d Denth said grimly. \u201cThese aren\u2019t long-distance caravans. Most of them will simply be coming into the city from the outlying farms.\u201d He nodded to Vivenna, and she pulled out a small pouch of coins. She handed them to him, and he tossed them to a nearby table.\n\nOne of the bodyguards investigated.\n\n\u201cFor your trouble in coming today,\u201d Denth said.\n\nVivenna watched the money go with a crimp in her stomach. It felt downright wrong to be using royal funds to bribe men like Grable. What she had just given away wasn\u2019t even a real bribe\u2014it was simply \u201cgrease money,\u201d as Denth put it.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Denth said, \u201cthe carts we\u2019re talking about\u2014\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d Grable said. \u201cLet\u2019s see the hair first.\u201d Vivenna sighed, moving to put up the shawl.\n\u201cNo shawl,\u201d Grable said. \u201cNo tricks. The men in this room are loyal.\u201d\n\nVivenna shot a glance at Denth, and he nodded. So she shifted colors a couple of times. Grable watched intently, scratching at his beard.\n\n\u201cNice,\u201d he finally said. \u201cNice indeed. Where\u2019d you find her?\u201d Denth frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cA person with enough royal blood to imitate one of the princesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s no impostor,\u201d Denth said as Tonk Fah continued to work on the plate of fried somethings. \u201cCome now,\u201d Grable said, smiling with a wide, uneven smile. \u201cYou can tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cBeing royal is about more than just blood. It\u2019s about lineage and the holy calling of Austre. My children will not have the Royal Locks unless I become queen of Idris. Only potential heirs have the ability to change their hair color.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuperstitious nonsense,\u201d Grable said. He leaned forward, ignoring her and focusing on Denth. \u201cI don\u2019t care about your caravans, Denth. I want to buy the girl from you. How much?\u201d\n\nDenth was silent.\n\n\u201cWord of her is spreading about town,\u201d Grable said. \u201cI see what you\u2019re doing. You could move a lot of people, make a lot of noise, with a person who seemed to be of the royal family. I don\u2019t know where you found her, or how you trained her so well, but I want her.\u201d\n\nDenth stood up slowly. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d he said. Grable\u2019s bodyguards stood up too.\n\nDenth moved.\n\nThere were flashes\u2014reflections of sunlight, and bodies moving too fast for Vivenna\u2019s shocked mind to follow. Then the motion stopped. Grable remained in his chair. Denth stood poised, his dueling blade sticking through the neck of one of the bodyguards.\n\nThe bodyguard looked surprised, his hand still on his sword. Vivenna hadn\u2019t even seen Denth draw his weapon. The other bodyguard stumbled, blood staining the front of his jerkin from where\u2014shockingly \u2014Denth seemed to have managed to stab him as well.\n\nHe slipped to the ground, bumping Grable\u2019s table in his death throes.\n\nLord of Colors . . . Vivenna thought. So fast!\n\n\u201cSo, you are as good as they say,\u201d Grable said, still looking unconcerned. Around the room, other men had stood. Some twenty of them. Tonk Fah grabbed another handful of fried things, then nudged Vivenna. \u201cWe might want to get up,\u201d he whispered.\n\nDenth pulled his sword free of the bodyguard\u2019s neck, and the man joined his friend, bleeding and dying on the floor. Denth slammed his sword into its sheath without wiping it, never breaking Grable\u2019s gaze.\n\u201cPeople speak of you,\u201d Grable said. \u201cSay you appeared out of nowhere a decade or so back. Gathered yourself a team of the best\u2014stole them from important men. Or important prisons. Nobody knows much about you, other than the fact that you\u2019re fast. Some say inhumanly so.\u201d\n\nDenth nodded toward the doorway. Vivenna stood nervously, then let Tonk Fah pull her through the room. The guards stood with their hands on their swords, but nobody attacked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity we couldn\u2019t do business,\u201d Grable said, sighing. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll think of me for future dealings.\u201d\n\nDenth finally turned away, joining Vivenna and Tonk Fah as they left the restaurant and moved out onto the sunny street. Parlin and Jewels hurried to catch up.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s letting us go?\u201d Vivenna asked, heart thumping.\n\n\u201cHe just wanted to see my blade,\u201d Denth said. He still seemed tense. \u201cIt happens sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarring that, he wanted to steal himself a princess,\u201d Tonk Fah added. \u201cHe either got to verify Denth\u2019s skill or he got you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut . . . you could have killed him!\u201d Vivenna said.\n\nTonk Fah snorted. \u201cAnd bring down the wrath of half the thieves, assassins, and burglars in the city? No, Grable knew he wasn\u2019t ever in any danger from us.\u201d\n\nDenth looked back at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for wasting your time\u2014I thought he\u2019d be more useful.\u201d\n\nShe frowned, noting for the first time the careful mask that Denth kept on his emotions. She\u2019d always thought of him as carefree, like Tonk Fah, but now she saw hints of something else. Control. Control that was, for the first time since they\u2019d met, in danger of cracking.\n\n\u201cWell, no harm done,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cExcept for those slobs that Denth poked,\u201d Tonk Fah added, happily feeding another morsel to his monkey.\n\n\u201cWe need to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess?\u201d a voice asked from the crowd.\n\nDenth and Tonk Fah both spun. Once again, Denth\u2019s sword was out before Vivenna could track. This time, however, he didn\u2019t strike. The man behind them didn\u2019t seem much of a threat. He wore ragged brown clothing, and had a leathery suntanned face. He had the look of a farmer.\n\n\u201cOh, Princess,\u201d the man said, hurrying forward, ignoring the blades. \u201cIt is you. I heard rumors, but . . . oh, you\u2019re here!\u201d\n\nDenth shot a look at Tonk Fah, and the larger mercenary reached out, putting a hand in front of the newcomer before he got too close to Vivenna. She would have thought the caution unnecessary had she just not seen Denth kill two men in an eyeblink. The danger Denth always talked about was slowly seeping into her mind. If this man had a hidden weapon and a little skill, he could kill her before she knew what was happening.\nIt was a chilling realization.\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d the man said, falling to his knees. \u201cI am your servant.\u201d \u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not put me above others.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d the man said, looking up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been so long since I left Idris! But, it is you!\u201d \u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Idrians in T\u2019Telir,\u201d the man said. \u201cThey say you\u2019ve come to take the throne back. We\u2019ve been oppressed here for so long that I thought people were just making up stories. But it\u2019s true! You\u2019re here!\u201d\n\nDenth glanced at her, then at Grable\u2019s restaurant, which was still close behind them. He nodded to Tonk Fah. \u201cGrab him, search him, and we\u2019ll talk somewhere else.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe \u201csomewhere else\u201d turned out to be a ragged dump of a building in a poor section of town about fifteen minutes from the restaurant.\n\nVivenna found the slums of T\u2019Telir to be very interesting, on an intellectual level at least. Even here, there was color. People wore faded clothing. Bright strips of cloth hung from windows, stretched across overhangs, and even sat in puddles on the street. Colors, muted or dirty. Like a carnival that had been hit by a mudslide.\n\nVivenna stood outside the shack with Jewels, Parlin, and the Idrian, waiting as Denth and Tonk Fah made sure the building wasn\u2019t hiding any unseen threats. She wrapped her arms around herself, feeling an odd sense of despair. The faded colors in the alley felt wrong. They were dead things. Like a beautiful bird that had fallen motionless to the ground, its shape intact, but the magic gone.\n\nRuined reds, stained yellows, broken greens. In T\u2019Telir, even simple things\u2014like chair legs and storage sacks\u2014were dyed bright colors. How much must the people of the city spend on dyes and inks? If it hadn\u2019t been for the Tears of Edgli, the vibrant flowers that grew only in the T\u2019Telir climate, it would have been impossible. Hallandren had made an entire economy out of growing, harvesting, and producing dyes from the special flowers.\n\nVivenna wrinkled her nose at the smell of refuse. Scents were more vibrant to her now, too, much like colors. It wasn\u2019t that her ability to smell was any better, the things that she smelled just seemed rich. She shivered. Even now, weeks after the infusion of Breath, she didn\u2019t feel normal. She could sense the teeming people of the city, could sense Parlin beside her, watching the nearby alleys with suspicion. She could sense Denth and Tonk Fah inside\u2014one of them appeared to be inspecting the basement.\n\nShe could . . .\n\nShe froze. She couldn\u2019t feel Jewels. She glanced to the side, but the shorter woman was there, hands on hips, muttering to herself about being left with the \u201ckids.\u201d Her Lifeless abomination was beside her; Vivenna hadn\u2019t expected to be able to feel it. Why couldn\u2019t she feel Jewels? Vivenna had a sharp\nmoment of panic, thinking that Jewels might be some twisted Lifeless creation. Then, however, she realized that there was a simple explanation.\n\nJewels had no Breath. She was a Drab.\n\nNow that Vivenna knew what to look for, it was obvious. Even without her wealth of Breath, Vivenna thought she might have been able to tell. There was less of a sparkle of life in Jewels\u2019s eyes. She seemed more grumpy, less pleasant. She seemed to put others on edge.\n\nPlus Jewels never noticed when Vivenna was watching her. Whatever sense made others glance about if they were watched for too long, Jewels didn\u2019t have it. Vivenna turned away, and found herself blushing. Seeing a person without Breath . . . it felt like spying on someone when they were changing. Seeing them exposed.\n\nPoor woman, she thought. I wonder how it happened. Had she sold it herself? Or had it been taken from her? Suddenly, Vivenna felt awkward. Why should I have so much, when she has nothing? It was the worst kind of ostentation.\n\nShe felt Denth approach before he actually pushed the door open. It looked ready to fall off its hinges. \u201cSafe,\u201d he said. Then he eyed Vivenna. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be involved with this, if you don\u2019t want to waste your time, Princess. Jewels can take you back to the house. We\u2019ll question the man and bring you word.\u201d\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cNo. I want to hear what he has to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI figured as much,\u201d Denth said. \u201cWe\u2019ll want to cancel our next appointment, though. Jewels, you\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Parlin said.\n\nDenth paused, glancing at Vivenna.\n\n\u201cLook, I may not understand everything going on in this city,\u201d Parlin said, \u201cbut I can deliver a simple message. I\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet him go,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cI trust him.\u201d\n\nDenth shrugged. \u201cAll right. Head straight down this alley until you find the square with the broken statue of a horse man, then turn east and follow that road through its curves. That\u2019ll take you out of the slum. The next appointment was to happen at a restaurant called the Armsman\u2019s Way; you\u2019ll find it in the market on the west side.\u201d\n\nParlin nodded and took off. Denth waved for Vivenna and the others to enter the building. The nervous Idrian man\u2014Thame\u2014went first. Vivenna followed him in, and was surprised to find that the inside of the building looked quite a bit sturdier than the outside had indicated. Tonk Fah found a stool, and he put it down in the center of the room.\n\n\u201cHave a seat, friend,\u201d Denth said, gesturing.\n\nThame nervously settled on the stool.\n\u201cNow,\u201d Denth said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you tell us how you found out that the princess was going to be in that particular restaurant today?\u201d\n\nThame glanced from side to side. \u201cI just happened to be walking in the area and I\u2014\u201d\n\nTonk Fah cracked his knuckles. Vivenna glanced at him, suddenly noticing that Tonk Fah seemed more . . . dangerous. The idle, overweight man who liked to nap had vanished. In his place was a thug with sleeves rolled up, showing off muscles that bulged impressively.\n\nThame was sweating. To the side, Clod the Lifeless stepped into the room, his inhuman eyes falling into shadow, his face looking like something molded in wax. A simulacrum of a human.\n\n\u201cI . . . run jobs for one of the bosses in the city,\u201d Thame said. \u201cLittle things. Nothing big. When you\u2019re one of us, you take the jobs you can get.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of us?\u201d Denth asked, resting his hand on the pommel of his sword.\n\n\u201cIdrian.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen Idrians in good positions in the city, friend,\u201d Denth said. \u201cMerchants. Moneylenders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lucky ones, sir,\u201d Thame said, gulping. \u201cThey have their own money. People will work with anyone who has money. If you\u2019re just an ordinary man, things are different. People look at your clothing, listen to your accent, and they find others to do their work. They say we\u2019re not trustworthy. Or that we\u2019re boring. Or that we steal.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd do you?\u201d Vivenna found herself asking.\n\nThame looked at her, then glanced down at the building\u2019s dirt floor. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not at first. I only do it now, when my boss asks me to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t answer how you knew where to find us, friend,\u201d Denth said quietly. His pointed use of the word \u201cfriend,\u201d when contrasted with Tonk Fah on one side and the Lifeless on the other, made Vivenna shiver.\n\n\u201cMy boss talks too much,\u201d Thame said. \u201cHe knew what was happening at that restaurant\u2014he sold the information to a couple of people. I heard for free.\u201d\n\nDenth glanced at Tonk Fah.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows she\u2019s in the city,\u201d Thame said quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard the rumors. It\u2019s no coincidence. Things are bad for us. Worse than they\u2019ve ever been. The princess came to help, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cFriend,\u201d Denth said. \u201cI think it\u2019s best that you forget this entire meeting. I realize that there will be the temptation to sell information. But I promise you, we can find out if you do that. And we can\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDenth, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cStop scaring the man.\u201d The mercenary glanced at her, causing Thame to jump.\n\u201cOh, for the Colors\u2019 sake,\u201d she said walking forward, crouching beside Thame\u2019s stool. \u201cNo harm will come to you, Thame. You have done well in seeking me out, and I trust you to keep news of our meeting quiet. But, tell me, if things are so bad in T\u2019Telir, why not return to Idris?\u201d\n\n\u201cTravel costs money, Your Highness,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t afford it\u2014most of us can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cAre there many of you here?\u201d Vivenna asked. \u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d\nVivenna nodded. \u201cI want to meet with the others.\u201d \u201cPrincess\u2014\u201d Denth said, but she silenced him with a glance.\n\u201cI can gather some together,\u201d Thame said, nodding eagerly. \u201cI promise. I\u2019m known to a lot of the Idrians.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cBecause I have come to help. How shall we contact you?\u201d \u201cAsk around for Rira,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my boss.\u201d\n\nVivenna rose and then gestured toward the doorway. Thame fled without further prompting. Jewels, who stood guarding the doorway, reluctantly stepped aside and let the man scuttle away.\n\nThe room was silent for a moment.\n\n\u201cJewels,\u201d Denth said. \u201cFollow him.\u201d\n\nShe nodded and was gone.\n\nVivenna glanced back at the two mercenaries, expecting to find them angry at her.\n\n\u201cAw, did you have to let him go so fast?\u201d Tonk Fah said, sitting down on the floor, looking morose.\n\nWhatever he\u2019d done to look dangerous was gone, evaporating faster than water on metal in the sun.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019ve done it,\u201d Denth said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be sullen for the rest of the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never get to be the bad guy anymore,\u201d Tonk Fah said, falling back and staring up at the ceiling. His monkey wandered over and sat atop his ample stomach.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get over it,\u201d Vivenna said, rolling her eyes. \u201cWhy were you so hard on him, anyway?\u201d Denth shrugged. \u201cYou know what I like least about being a mercenary?\u201d \u201cI suspect that you\u2019re going to tell me,\u201d Vivenna said, folding her arms.\n\u201cPeople are always trying to fool you,\u201d he said, sitting down on the floor beside Tonk Fah. \u201cThey all think that because you\u2019re hired muscle, you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\nHe paused, as if expecting Tonk Fah to give his usual counterpoint. Instead, however, the bulky mercenary just continued to stare at the ceiling. \u201cArsteel always got to be the mean one,\u201d he said.\n\nDenth sighed, giving Vivenna a \u201cThis is your fault\u201d look. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he continued. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be sure that our friend there wasn\u2019t a plant arranged by Grable. He could have pretended to be a loyal subject, gotten inside our defenses, then knifed you in the back. Best to be safe.\u201d\nShe sat down on the stool, and was tempted to say that he was overreacting, but . . . well, she had just seen him kill two men in her defense. I\u2019m paying them, she thought. I should probably just let them do their job. \u201cTonk Fah,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can be the mean one next time.\u201d\n\nHe looked up. \u201cYou promise?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCan I yell at the person we are interrogating?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCan I growl at him?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCan I break his fingers?\u201d\n\nShe frowned. \u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even the unimportant ones?\u201d Tonk Fah asked. \u201cI mean, people have five after all. The little ones don\u2019t even do that much.\u201d\n\nVivenna paused, then Tonk Fah and Denth started laughing.\n\n\u201cOh, honestly,\u201d she said, turning away. \u201cI can never tell when you shift from being serious to being ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes it so funny,\u201d Tonk Fah said, still chuckling.\n\n\u201cAre we leaving, then?\u201d Vivenna said, rising.\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d Denth said. \u201cLet\u2019s wait a bit. I\u2019m still not sure that Grable isn\u2019t looking for us. Best to lay low for a few hours.\u201d\n\nShe frowned, glancing at Denth. Tonk Fah, amazingly, was already snoring softly.\n\n\u201cI thought you said that Grable would let us go,\u201d she said. \u201cThat he was just testing us\u2014that he wanted to see how good you were.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely,\u201d Denth said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been known to be wrong. He might have let us go because he was worried about my sword being so close to him. He could be having second thoughts. We\u2019ll give it a few hours, then head back and ask my watchers if anyone has been poking around the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWatchers?\u201d Vivenna asked. \u201cYou have people watching our house?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Denth said. \u201cKids work cheap in the city. Worth the coin, even when you\u2019re not protecting a princess from a rival kingdom.\u201d\n\nShe folded her arms, standing. She didn\u2019t feel like sitting, so she began to pace.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about Grable,\u201d Denth said, eyes closed as he sat back, leaning against the wall. \u201cThis is just a precaution.\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cIt makes sense that he\u2019d want revenge, Denth,\u201d she said. \u201cYou killed two of his men.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen can be cheap in this city too, Princess.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say he was testing you,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cBut what would be the point of that? Provoking you to action just to let you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo see how much of a threat I was,\u201d Denth said, shrugging, eyes still closed. \u201cOr, more likely, to see if I was worth the pay I usually demand. Again, I wouldn\u2019t worry so much.\u201d\n\nShe sighed, then wandered over to the window so she could watch the street. \u201cYou should probably stay away from the window,\u201d Denth said. \u201cJust to be safe.\u201d\n\nFirst he tells me not to worry, then he tells me not to let myself be seen, she thought with frustration, walking toward the back of the room, moving toward the door down to the cellar.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that, either,\u201d Denth noted. \u201cStairs are broken in a few places. Not much to see, anyway. Dirt floor. Dirt walls. Dirt ceiling.\u201d\n\nShe sighed again, turning away from the door.\n\n\u201cWhat is with you, anyway?\u201d he asked, still not opening his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not usually this nervous.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing locked in like this makes me anxious.\u201d \u201cI thought princesses were taught to be patient,\u201d Denth noted.\n\nHe\u2019s right, she realized. That sounded like something Siri would say. What is wrong with me lately? She forced herself to sit down on the stool, folding her hands in her lap, reasserting control of her hair, which had rebelliously started to lighten to a brown. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said, forcing herself to sound patient, \u201ctell me of this place. Why did you select this building?\u201d\n\nDenth cracked an eyelid. \u201cWe rent it,\u201d he finally said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have safe houses around the city. Since we don\u2019t use them very often, we find the cheapest ones we can.\u201d\n\nI noticed, Vivenna thought, but fell silent, recognizing how stilted her attempt at conversation had sounded. She sat quietly, looking down at her hands, trying to figure out just what had set her on edge.\n\nIt was more than the fight. The truth was, she was worried about how long things in T\u2019Telir were taking. Her father would have received her letter two weeks before and would know thattwo of his daughters were in Hallandren. She could only hope that the logic of her letter, mixed with her threats, would keep him from doing anything foolish.\n\nShe was glad Denth had made her abandon Lemex\u2019s house. If her father did send agents to retrieve her, they would naturally try to find Lemex first\u2014just as she had. However, a cowardly part of her wished that Denth hadn\u2019t shown such foresight. If they were still living in Lemex\u2019s home, she might have been discovered already. And be on her way back to Idris.\nShe acted so determined. Indeed, sometimes she felt quite determined. Those were the times when she thought about Siri or her kingdom\u2019s needs. However, those times\u2014the royal times\u2014were actually rather rare. The rest of the time, she wondered.\n\nWhat was she doing? She didn\u2019t know about subterfuge or warfare. Denth was really behind everything she was \u201cdoing\u201d to help Idris. What she had suspected on that first day had proved true. Her preparation and study amounted to little. She didn\u2019t know how to go about saving Siri. She didn\u2019t know what to do about the Breath she held within her. She didn\u2019t even know, really, if she wanted to stay in this insane, overcrowded, overcolored city.\n\nIn short, she was useless. And that was the one thing, above all else, that her training had never prepared her to deal with.\n\n\u201cYou really want to meet with the Idrians?\u201d Denth asked. Vivenna looked up. Outside, it was growing darker as evening approached.\n\nDo I? she thought. If my father has agents in the city, they might be there. But, if there\u2019s something I can do for those people . . .\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to,\u201d she said.\n\nHe fell silent.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like it,\u201d she said.\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cIt will be hard to arrange, hard to keep quiet, and will make you hard to protect. These meetings we\u2019ve been having\u2014they\u2019ve all been in controlled areas. If you meet with the common folk, that won\u2019t be possible.\u201d\n\nShe nodded quietly. \u201cI want to do it anyway. I have to do something, Denth. Something useful. Being paraded before these contacts of yours is helping. But I need to do more. If war is coming, we need to prepare these people. Help them, somehow.\u201d\n\nShe looked up, staring out toward the windows. Clod the Lifeless stood in the corner where Jewels had left him. Vivenna shivered, looking away. \u201cI want to help my sister,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I want to be useful to my people. But I can\u2019t help feeling that I\u2019m not doing much for Idris by staying in the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter than leaving,\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cWhy?\n\n\u201cBecause if you left, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone to pay me.\u201d She rolled her eyes.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t joking,\u201d Denth noted. \u201cI really do like getting paid. However, there are better reasons to stay.\u201d \u201cLike what?\u201d she asked.\n\nHe shrugged. \u201cDepends, I guess. Look, Princess, I\u2019m not the type to give brilliant advice or deep counsel. I\u2019m a mercenary. You pay me, you point me, and I go stab things. But I figure that if you think about it, you\u2019ll find that running back to Idris is about the least useful thing you could do. You won\u2019t be\nable to do anything there other than sit about and knit doilies. Your father has other heirs. Here, you might be largely ineffective\u2014but there you\u2019re completely redundant.\u201d\n\nHe fell silent, stretching, leaning back a little more. Tough man to have a conversation with, sometimes, Vivenna thought to herself, shaking her head. Still, she found his words comforting. She smiled, turning.\n\nAnd found Clod standing right beside her stool.\n\nShe yelped, half-scrambling, half-falling backward. Denth was on his feet in a heartbeat, sword drawn, and Tonk Fah wasn\u2019t far behind.\n\nVivenna stumbled to her feet, her skirts getting in the way, and placed a hand against her chest, as if to still her heartbeat. The Lifeless stood, watching her.\n\n\u201cHe does that sometimes,\u201d Denth said, chuckling, though it sounded false to Vivenna. \u201cJust walks up to people.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike he was curious about them,\u201d Tonk Fah said.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t be curious,\u201d Denth said. \u201cNo emotion at all. Clod. Go back to your corner.\u201d The Lifeless turned and began to walk.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Vivenna said, shivering. \u201cPut it in the basement.\u201d \u201cBut, the stairs\u2014\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d Vivenna snapped, hair tingeing red at the tips.\n\nDenth sighed. \u201cClod, to the cellar.\u201d\n\nThe Lifeless turned and walked to the door at the back. As he went down the steps, Vivenna heard one crack slightly, but the creature made it safely, judging by the sound of his footsteps. She sat back down, trying to calm her breathing.\n\n\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t feel him,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cIt\u2019s unnerving. I forget that he\u2019s there, and don\u2019t notice when he approaches.\u201d\n\nDenth nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cJewels, too,\u201d she said, glancing at him. \u201cShe is a Drab.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Denth said, settling back down. \u201cHas been since she was a child. Her parents sold her Breath to one of the gods.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey each need a Breath a week to survive,\u201d Tonk Fah added.\n\n\u201cHow horrible,\u201d Vivenna said. I really need to show her more kindness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not so bad,\u201d Denth said. \u201cI\u2019ve been without Breath myself.\u201d \u201cYou have?\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cEveryone goes through times when they\u2019re short of coin. The nice thing about Breath is that you can always buy one off someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody is always selling,\u201d Tonk Fah said.\n\nVivenna shook her head, shivering. \u201cBut you have to live without it for a time. Have no soul.\u201d\n\nDenth laughed\u2014and this time it was definitely genuine. \u201cOh, that\u2019s just superstition, Princess. Lacking Breath doesn\u2019t change you that much.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes you less kind,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cMore irritable. Like . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cJewels?\u201d Denth asked, amused. \u201cNah, she\u2019d be like that anyway. I\u2019m sure of it. Either way, when I\u2019ve sold my Breath, I didn\u2019t feel much different. You really have to pay attention to even notice it\u2019s missing.\u201d\n\nVivenna turned away. She didn\u2019t expect him to understand. It was easy to call her beliefs superstition, but she could just as easily turn the words back on Denth. People saw what they wanted to see. If he believed he felt the same without Breath, that was just an easy way to rationalize the selling of it\u2014and then purchase of another Breath from an innocent person. Besides, why even bother buying one back if it didn\u2019t matter?\n\nThe conversation died off until Jewels returned. She walked in and, once again, Vivenna barely noticed her. I\u2019m starting to rely on that life sense far too much, she thought with annoyance, standing as Jewels nodded to Denth.\n\n\u201cHe is who he says he is,\u201d Jewels said. \u201cI asked around, got three confirmations from people I kind of trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Denth said, stretching and climbing to his feet. He kicked Tonk Fah awake. \u201cLet\u2019s carefully head back to the house.\u201d\n\nLightsong found Blushweaver in the grassy portion of the courtyard behind her palace. She was enjoying the art of one of the city\u2019s master gardeners.\n\nLightsong strolled through the grass, his entourage hovering around him, holding up a large parasol to shield him from the sun, and generally seeing that he was suitably pampered. He passed hundreds of planters, pots, and vases filled with various kinds of growing things, all arranged into elaborate formal patterns and rows.\n\nTemporary flower beds. The gods were too godly to leave the court and visit the city gardens, so the gardens had to be brought to them. Such an enormous undertaking required dozens of workers and carts full of plants. Nothing was too good for the gods.\n\nExcept, of course, freedom.\n\nBlushweaver stood admiring one of the patterns of vases. She noticed Lightsong as he approached, his moving BioChroma successively making the flowers shine more vibrantly in the afternoon sunlight. She was wearing a surprisingly modest dress. It had no sleeves and appeared to be made entirely of a single wrapping of green silk, but it covered up the essential bits and then some.\n\u201cLightsong, dear,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cVisiting a lady in her home? How charmingly forward. Well, enough of this small talk. Let us retire to the bedroom.\u201d\n\nHe smiled, holding up a sheet of paper as he approached her.\n\nShe paused, then accepted it. The front was covered with colored dots\u2014the artisans\u2019 script. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI figured I knew how our conversation would begin,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I saved us the trouble of having to go through it. I had it written out beforehand.\u201d\n\nBlushweaver raised an eyebrow, then read. \u201c \u2018To start, Blushweaver says something that is mildly suggestive.\u2019 \u201d She glanced at him. \u201cMildly? I invited you to the bedroom. I\u2019d call that blatant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI underestimated you,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cPlease continue.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018Then Lightsong says something to deflect her,\u2019 \u201d Blushweaver read. \u201c \u2018It is so incredibly charming and clever that she is left stunned by his brilliance and cannot speak for several minutes . . .\u2019 Oh, honestly, Lightsong. Do I have to read this?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a masterpiece,\u201d he said. \u201cBest work I\u2019ve ever done. Please, the next part is important.\u201d\n\nShe sighed. \u201c \u2018Blushweaver says something about politics which is dreadfully boring but she offsets it by wiggling her chest. After that, Lightsong apologizes for being so distant lately. He explains that he had some things to work out.\u2019 \u201d She paused, eyeing him. \u201cDoes this mean that you\u2019re finally ready to be part of my plans?\u201d\n\nHe nodded. To the side, a group of gardeners removed the flowers. They returned in waves, building a pattern of small blossoming trees in large pots around Blushweaver and Lightsong, a living kaleidoscope with the two Returned gods at its center.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the queen is involved in a plot to take the throne,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve spoken with her only briefly, I am convinced.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why agree to join with me?\u201d\n\nHe stood quietly for a moment, enjoying the blossoms. \u201cBecause,\u201d he said. \u201cI intend to see that you don\u2019t crush her. Or the rest of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Lightsong,\u201d Blushweaver said, pursing bright red lips. \u201cI assure you that I\u2019m harmless.\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, now,\u201d she said, \u201cyou should never point out a lady\u2019s departure from strict truth. Anyway, I\u2019m glad you came. We have work to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWork?\u201d he said. \u201cThat sounds like . . . work.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, dear,\u201d she said, walking away. Gardeners immediately ran forward, pulling aside the small trees to clear a path for them. The master gardener himself stood by directing the evolving composition like the conductor of a botanical orchestra.\nLightsong hurried and caught up. \u201cWork,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know what my philosophy on that word is?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have somehow gotten the subtle impression that you do not approve of it,\u201d Blushweaver said. \u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t say that. Work, my dear Blushweaver, is like fertilizer.\u201d \u201cIt smells?\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cNo, I was thinking that work is like fertilizer in that I\u2019m glad it exists; I just don\u2019t ever want to get stuck in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Blushweaver said. \u201cBecause you just agreed to do so.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI thought I smelled something.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be tedious,\u201d she said, smiling to some workers as they lined her path with vases of flowers. \u201cThis is going to be fun.\u201d She turned back to him, eyes twinkling. \u201cMercystar got attacked last night.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh, my dear Blushweaver. It was positively tragic.\u201d\n\nLightsong raised an eyebrow. Mercystar was a gorgeously voluptuous woman who offered a striking contrast with Blushweaver. Both were, of course, perfect examples of feminine beauty. Blushweaver was simply the slim\u2014yet busty\u2014type while Mercystar was the curvaceous\u2014yet busty\u2014type.\n\nMercystar lounged back on a plush couch, being fanned with large palm leaves by several of her serving men.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have Blushweaver\u2019s subtle sense of style. There was a skill to choosing bright clothing that didn\u2019t edge into garishness. Lightsong himself didn\u2019t have it\u2014but he had servants who did. Mercystar, apparently, didn\u2019t even know such a skill existed.\n\nThough admittedly, he thought, orange and gold aren\u2019t exactly the easiest colors to wear with dignity.\n\n\u201cMercystar, dear,\u201d Blushweaver said warmly. One of the servants provided a cushioned stool, sliding it beneath Blushweaver just as she sat at Mercystar\u2019s elbow. \u201cI can understand how you must feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you?\u201d Mercystar asked. \u201cCan you possibly? This is terrible. Some . . . somemiscreant snuck into my palace, accosting my servants! The very home of a goddess! Who would do such a thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, he must have been deranged,\u201d Blushweaver said soothingly. Lightsong stood beside her, smiling sympathetically, hands clasped behind his back. A cool afternoon breeze blew across the courtyard and through the pavilion. Some of Blushweaver\u2019s gardeners had brought over flowers and trees, surrounding the pavilion\u2019s canopy, filling the air with their mingled perfumes.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t understand it,\u201d Mercystar said. \u201cThe guards at the gates are supposed to prevent these kinds of things! Why do we have walls if people can just walk in and violate our homes? I just don\u2019t feel safe anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain the guards will be more diligent in the future,\u201d Blushweaver said.\nLightsong frowned, glancing toward Mercystar\u2019s palace, where servants buzzed about like bees around a disturbed hive. \u201cWhat was the intruder after, do you suppose?\u201d he said, almost to himself. \u201cWorks of art, perhaps? Surely there are merchants who would be much easier to rob.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may not know what they want,\u201d Blushweaver said smoothly, \u201cbut we at least knowsomething about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do?\u201d Mercystar said, perking up.\n\n\u201cYes, dear,\u201d Blushweaver said. \u201cOnly someone with no respect for tradition, propriety, or religion would dare trespass in the home of a god. Someone base. Disrespectful. Unbelieving . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAn Idrian?\u201d Mercystar asked.\n\n\u201cDid you ever wonder, dear,\u201d Blushweaver said, \u201cwhy they sent their youngest daughter to the God King instead of their eldest?\u201d\n\nMercystar frowned. \u201cThey did?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, dear,\u201d Blushweaver said.\n\n\u201cThat is rather suspicious, now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething is going on in the Court of Gods, Mercystar,\u201d Blushweaver said, leaning over. \u201cThese could be dangerous times for the Crown.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlushweaver,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cA word, if you please?\u201d\n\nShe eyed him in annoyance. He met her gaze steadily, which eventually caused her to sigh. She patted Mercystar\u2019s hand and then retreated from the pavilion with Lightsong, their servants and priests trailing behind.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lightsong said as soon as they were out of Mercystar\u2019s hearing. \u201cRecruiting,\u201d Blushweaver said, a glint in her eye. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need her Lifeless Commands.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still not myself persuaded that we will need them,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cWar may not be necessary.\u201d \u201cAs I said,\u201d Blushweaver replied, \u201cwe need to be careful. I\u2019m just making preparations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. There was a wisdom to that. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know that it was an Idrian who broke into Mercystar\u2019s palace. Why are you implying that it was?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think it\u2019s just coincidence? Someone sneaks into one of our palaces now, with the war approaching?\u201d\n\n\u201cCoincidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the intruder just happened to pick one of the four Returned who hold Lifeless access Commands? If I were going to go to war with Hallandren, the first thing I\u2019d do would be try to search out those commands. Maybe see if they were written down anywhere, or perhaps try to kill the gods who held them.\u201d\nLightsong glanced back at the palace. Blushweaver\u2019s arguments held some merit, but they weren\u2019t enough. He had an odd impulse to look into this more deeply. However, that sounded like work. He really couldn\u2019t afford to make an exception to his usual habits, particularly without a lot of complaining first. It set a poor pre cedent. So he just nodded his head, and Blushweaver led them back to the pavilion.\n\n\u201cDear,\u201d Blushweaver said, quickly sitting back beside Mercystar and looking a little bit more anxious. She leaned in. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked it over and decided to trust you.\u201d\n\nMercystar sat up. \u201cTrust me? With what?\u201d\n\n\u201cKnowledge,\u201d Blushweaver whispered. \u201cThere are those of us who fear that the Idrians aren\u2019t content with their mountains and are determined to control the lowlands as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ll be joined by blood,\u201d Mercystar said. \u201cThere will be a Hallandren God King with royal blood on our throne.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Blushweaver said. \u201cAnd could that not also be interpreted as an Idrian king with Hallandren blood on the throne?\u201d\n\nMercystar wavered. Then, oddly, she glanced at Lightsong. \u201cDo you believe this?\u201d\n\nWhy did people look toward him? He did everything to discourage such behavior, but they still tended to act like he was some kind of moral authority. \u201cI think that some . . . preparation would be wise,\u201d he said. \u201cThough, of course, the same can be said for dinner.\u201d\n\nBlushweaver gave him an annoyed look, though by the time she looked back at Mercystar, she had her consoling face on again. \u201cWe understand that you\u2019ve had a difficult day,\u201d she said. \u201cBut please, consider our offer. We would like you to join with us in our precautions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of precautions are you talking about?\u201d Mercystar asked.\n\n\u201cSimple ones,\u201d Blushweaver said quickly. \u201cThinking, talking, planning. Eventually, if we think we have enough evidence, we will bring what we know to the God King.\u201d\n\nThis seemed to ease Mercystar\u2019s mind. She nodded. \u201cYes, I can see. Preparation. It wouldbe wise.\u201d\n\n\u201cRest now, dear,\u201d Blushweaver said, rising and leading Lightsong away from the pavilion. They walked leisurely across the perfect lawn back toward Blushweaver\u2019s own palace. He felt a reluctance to go, however. Something about the meeting bothered him.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a dear,\u201d Blushweaver said, smiling.\n\n\u201cYou just say that because she\u2019s so easy to manipulate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Blushweaver said. \u201cI positively love people who do as they should. \u2018Should\u2019 being defined as whatever I think is best.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least you\u2019re open about it,\u201d Lightsong said.\n\n\u201cTo you, my dear, I\u2019m as easy to read as a book.\u201d\nHe snorted. \u201cMaybe one that hasn\u2019t been translated to Hallandren yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just say that because you\u2019ve never really tried reading me,\u201d she said, smiling at him. \u201cThough, I must say that there is one thing about dear Mercystar that positively annoys me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is?\u201d\n"], "title": ["Warbreaker"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson"]}
