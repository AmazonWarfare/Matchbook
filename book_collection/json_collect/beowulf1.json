The passage would then\n    read: _The firm and hand-locked war-burnie shone, bright ring-mail,\n    rang 'mid the armor, etc_.\n\n    [2] Gr. and others translate 'unh\u00e1r' by 'bald'; _old and bald_.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nHROTHGAR AND BEOWULF.\n\n\n{Hrothgar remembers Beowulf as a youth, and also remembers his father.}\n\n          Hrothgar answered, helm of the Scyldings:\n          \"I remember this man as the merest of striplings.\n          His father long dead now was Ecgtheow titled,\n          Him Hrethel the Geatman granted at home his\n        5 One only daughter; his battle-brave son\n          Is come but now, sought a trustworthy friend.\n          Seafaring sailors asserted it then,\n\n{Beowulf is reported to have the strength of thirty men.}\n\n          Who valuable gift-gems of the Geatmen[1] carried\n          As peace-offering thither, that he thirty men's grapple\n       10 Has in his hand, the hero-in-battle.\n\n{God hath sent him to our rescue.}\n\n          The holy Creator usward sent him,\n          To West-Dane warriors, I ween, for to render\n          'Gainst Grendel's grimness gracious assistance:\n          I shall give to the good one gift-gems for courage.\n       15 Hasten to bid them hither to speed them,[2]\n          To see assembled this circle of kinsmen;\n          Tell them expressly they're welcome in sooth to\n          The men of the Danes.\" To the door of the building\n\n[15]\n\n{Wulfgar invites the strangers in.}\n\n          Wulfgar went then, this word-message shouted:\n       20 \"My victorious liegelord bade me to tell you,\n          The East-Danes' atheling, that your origin knows he,\n          And o'er wave-billows wafted ye welcome are hither,\n          Valiant of spirit.

If this be accepted, change '_of_ the Geatmen' to\n    '_to_ the Geatmen.'\n\n    [2] If t.B.'s emendation of vv. 386, 387 be accepted, the two lines,\n    'Hasten ... kinsmen' will read: _Hasten thou, bid the throng of\n    kinsmen go into the hall together_.\n\n    [3] For 420 (_b_) and 421 (_a_), B. suggests: \u00de\u00e6r ic (on) f\u00edfelgeban\n    \u00fd\u00f0de eotena cyn = _where I in the ocean destroyed the\n    eoten-race_.--t.B. accepts B.'s \"brilliant\" 'f\u00edfelgeban,' omits 'on,'\n    emends 'cyn' to 'h\u00e1m,' arranging: \u00de\u00e6r ic f\u00edfelgeban \u00fd\u00f0de, eotena h\u00e1m =\n    _where I desolated the ocean, the home of the eotens_.--This would be\n    better but for changing 'cyn' to 'h\u00e1m.'--I suggest: \u00de\u00e6r ic f\u00edfelgeband\n    (cf. nhd. Bande) \u00fd\u00f0de, eotena cyn = _where I conquered the monster\n    band, the race of the eotens_. This makes no change except to read\n    '_f\u00edfel_' for '_f\u00edfe_.'\n\n    [4] 'Unforhte' (444) is much disputed.--H.-So. wavers between adj. and\n    adv. Gr. and B. take it as an adv. modifying _etan: Will eat the Geats\n    fearlessly_.--Kl. considers this reading absurd, and proposes\n    'anforhte' = timid.--Understanding 'unforhte' as an adj. has this\n    advantage, viz. that it gives a parallel to 'Ge\u00e1tena le\u00f3de': but to\n    take it as an adv. is more natural. Furthermore, to call the Geats\n    'brave' might, at this point, seem like an implied thrust at the\n    Danes, so long helpless; while to call his own men 'timid' would be\n    befouling his own nest.\n\n    [5] For 'head-watch,' cf. H.-So. notes and cf. v. 2910.--Th.\n    translates: _Thou wilt not need my head to hide_ (i.e., thou wilt have\n    no occasion to bury me, as Grendel will devour me whole).--Simrock\n    imagines a kind of dead-watch.--Dr. H. Wood suggests: _Thou wilt not\n    have to bury so much as my head_ (for Grendel will be a thorough\n    undertaker),--grim humor.\n\n    [6] S. proposes a colon after 'nime\u00f0' (l. 447). This would make no\n    essential change in the translation.\n\n    [7] Owing to the vagueness of 'feorme' (451), this passage is\n    variously translated. In our translation, H.-So.'s glossary has been\n    quite closely followed. This agrees substantially with B.'s\n    translation (P. and B. XII. 87). R. translates: _Thou needst not take\n    care longer as to the consumption of my dead body._ 'L\u00edc' is also a\n    crux here, as it may mean living body or dead body.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nHROTHGAR AND BEOWULF.--_Continued_.\n\n\n{Hrothgar responds.}\n\n          Hrothgar discoursed, helm of the Scyldings:\n          \"To defend our folk and to furnish assistance,[1]\n          Thou soughtest us hither, good friend Beowulf.\n\n{Reminiscences of Beowulf's father, Ecgtheow.}\n\n          The fiercest of feuds thy father engaged in,\n        5 Heatholaf killed he in hand-to-hand conflict\n          'Mid Wilfingish warriors; then the Wederish people\n          For fear of a feud were forced to disown him.\n          Thence flying he fled to the folk of the South-Danes,\n[18]      The race of the Scyldings, o'er the roll of the waters;\n       10 I had lately begun then to govern the Danemen,\n          The hoard-seat of heroes held in my youth,\n          Rich in its jewels: dead was Heregar,\n          My kinsman and elder had earth-joys forsaken,\n          Healfdene his bairn.

Of these the boldest\n    is to regard 'meoto' as a verb (imperative), and read 'on s\u00e6l': _Think\n    upon gayety, etc_.--All the renderings are unsatisfactory, the one\n    given in our translation involving a zeugma.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nUNFERTH TAUNTS BEOWULF.\n\n\n{Unferth, a thane of Hrothgar, is jealous of Beowulf, and undertakes to\ntwit him.}\n\n          Unferth spoke up, Ecglaf his son,\n          Who sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings,\n          Opened the jousting (the journey[1] of Beowulf,\n          Sea-farer doughty, gave sorrow to Unferth\n        5 And greatest chagrin, too, for granted he never\n          That any man else on earth should attain to,\n          Gain under heaven, more glory than he):\n\n{Did you take part in a swimming-match with Breca?}\n\n          \"Art thou that Beowulf with Breca did struggle,\n          On the wide sea-currents at swimming contended,\n       10 Where to humor your pride the ocean ye tried,\n\n{'Twas mere folly that actuated you both to risk your lives on the ocean.}\n\n          From vainest vaunting adventured your bodies\n          In care of the waters?
