The Professor encourages her, and whispers to\nme that it may be a week before we can get any good food again.

There will not be any chance of\nour being cold.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe shall soon be off. I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are\ntruly in the hands of God.

The\nhorses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go\nwillingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many\nchanges and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to\nthink that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;\nhe tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well\nto make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and\noff we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable\nkinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full\nof nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first\nhouse where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my\nforehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to\nkeep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an\nextra amount of garlic into our food; and I can't abide garlic. Ever\nsince then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have\nescaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no\ndriver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay\nthat fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The\nProfessor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he\nmade me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he\nsays that I answered as usual \"darkness, lapping water and creaking\nwood\"; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of\nJonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write\nthis whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.\nVan Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and\ngrey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's; even in his sleep\nhe is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make\nhim rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,\nand we must not break down when most of all his strength will be\nneeded.... All is ready; we are off shortly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_2 November, morning._--I was successful, and we took turns driving all\nnight; now the day is on us, bright though cold. There is a strange\nheaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean\nthat it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep\nus comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered\n\"darkness, creaking wood and roaring water,\" so the river is changing as\nthey ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of\ndanger--more than need be; but we are in God's hands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_2 November, night._--All day long driving. The country gets wilder as\nwe go, and the great spurs of the Carpathians, which at Veresti seemed\nso far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us\nand tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an\neffort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.\nVan Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The\nhouses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse\nwe got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He\ngot two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude\nfour-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no\ntrouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can\ndrive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive\nbefore. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what\nwill to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor\ndarling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and\nthat He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,\nand who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His\nsight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign\nto let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred\nHis wrath.\n\n\n_Memorandum by Abraham Van Helsing._\n\n_4 November._--This to my old and true friend John Seward, M.D., of\nPurfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is\nmorning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept\nalive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey\nheavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all\nwinter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have\naffected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was\nnot like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual\nso alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost\nher appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so\nfaithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.\nHowever, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh\nand restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset\nI try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown\nless and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,\nGod's will be done--whatever it may be, and whithersoever it may lead!\n\nNow to the historical, for as Madam Mina write not in her stenography, I\nmust, in my cumbrous old fashion, that so each day of us may not go\nunrecorded.\n\nWe got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I\nsaw the signs of the dawn I got ready for the hypnotism. We stopped our\ncarriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a\ncouch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but\nmore slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As\nbefore, came the answer: \"darkness and the swirling of water.\" Then she\nwoke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.\nAt this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new\nguiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--\n\n\"This is the way.\"\n\n\"How know you it?\" I ask.\n\n\"Of course I know it,\" she answer, and with a pause, add: \"Have not my\nJonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?\"\n\nAt first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one\nsuch by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach\nroad from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and\nmore of use.\n\nSo we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we\nsure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow\nhave fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and\nthey go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan\nhave note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long\nhours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and\nshe succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to\nsuspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may\nnot wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm\nher; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be\nall-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel\nguilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the\nreins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I\nlook down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset\ntime, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,\nso that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.\nFor we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though\nit were the end of the world.\n\nThen I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and\nthen I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as\nthough I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and\nmyself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.\nMadam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,\nand look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we\nfirst enter the Count's house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she\nis so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I\nlight a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she\nprepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,\nto feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go\nto help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that\nshe was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have\ngrave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She\nhelp me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the\nfire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all\nof watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying\nquiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice\nmore the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I\nwake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes\nobedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then\nsleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have\nto lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have\nharnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look\nin her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it\nnot. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even\nto think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and\ndeath, or more than these, and we must not flinch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_5 November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though you\nand I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think\nthat I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long\nstrain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.\n\nAll yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and\nmoving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,\nfrowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held\nsometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I\ndid have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. I\nbegan to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as\nshe is with that Vampire baptism. \"Well,\" said I to myself, \"if it be\nthat she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at\nnight.\" As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and\nimperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked\nwith a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still\nsleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning\nmountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a\nsteep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell\nof in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,\nthe end was near.\n\nI woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!\nunavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for\neven after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and\nall was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed\nthem in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make\nMadam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid\nher rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that\nshe had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But\nI myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the\nfear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round\nwhere Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and\nI broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the\ntime--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the\nsnow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she\nclung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to\nfeet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when\nshe had grown more quiet:--\n\n\"Will you not come over to the fire?\" for I wished to make a test of\nwhat she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she\nstopped, and stood as one stricken.\n\n\"Why not go on?\" I asked. She shook her head, and, coming back, sat\ndown in her place. Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked\nfrom sleep, she said simply:--\n\n\"I cannot!\" and remained silent. I rejoiced, for I knew that what she\ncould not, none of those that we dreaded could. Though there might be\ndanger to her body, yet her soul was safe!\n\nPresently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till I\ncame to them and quieted them. When they did feel my hands on them, they\nwhinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet for a\ntime. Many times through the night did I come to them, till it arrive to\nthe cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time my coming was\nwith quiet of them. In the cold hour the fire began to die, and I was\nabout stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow came in flying\nsweeps and with it a chill mist. Even in the dark there was a light of\nsome kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the\nsnow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with\ntrailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses\nwhinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to\nfear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that\nring wherein I stood. I began, too, to think that my imaginings were of\nthe night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through, and\nall the terrible anxiety. It was as though my memories of all Jonathan's\nhorrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and the mist\nbegan to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though a shadowy\nglimpse of those women that would have kissed him. And then the horses\ncowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in pain. Even\nthe madness of fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I\nfeared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and\ncircled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when\nI would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held\nme back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low\nit was:--\n\n\"No! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!\" I turned to her, and\nlooking in her eyes, said:--\n\n\"But you? It is for you that I fear!\" whereat she laughed--a laugh, low\nand unreal, and said:--\n\n\"Fear for _me_! Why fear for me? None safer in all the world from them\nthan I am,\" and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of\nwind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.\nThen, alas! I knew. Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the\nwheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without\nthe Holy circle. Then they began to materialise till--if God have not\ntake away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before me\nin actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room, when\nthey would have kissed his throat. I knew the swaying round forms, the\nbright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous\nlips. They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came\nthrough the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to\nher, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were\nof the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--\n\n\"Come, sister. Come to us. Come! Come!\" In fear I turned to my poor\nMadam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh! the\nterror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my\nheart that was all of hope. God be thanked she was not, yet, of them. I\nseized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of the\nWafer, advanced on them towards the fire. They drew back before me, and\nlaughed their low horrid laugh. I fed the fire, and feared them not; for\nI knew that we were safe within our protections. They could not\napproach, me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained within\nthe ring, which she could not leave no more than they could enter. The\nhorses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the snow fell on\nthem softly, and they grew whiter. I knew that there was for the poor\nbeasts no more of terror.\n\nAnd so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the\nsnow-gloom. I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror; but\nwhen that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again.\nAt the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the\nwhirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away\ntowards the castle, and were lost.\n\nInstinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending\nto hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I\ncould not wake her. I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she made\nno response, none at all; and the day broke. I fear yet to stir. I have\nmade my fire and have seen the horses, they are all dead. To-day I have\nmuch to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for there\nmay be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow and mist\nobscure it, will be to me a safety.\n\nI will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible\nwork. Madam Mina still sleeps; and, God be thanked! she is calm in her\nsleep....\n\n\n_Jonathan Harker's Journal._\n\n_4 November, evening._--The accident to the launch has been a terrible\nthing for us. Only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago;\nand by now my dear Mina would have been free. I fear to think of her,\noff on the wolds near that horrid place. We have got horses, and we\nfollow on the track. I note this whilst Godalming is getting ready. We\nhave our arms. The Szgany must look out if they mean fight. Oh, if only\nMorris and Seward were with us. We must only hope! If I write no more\nGood-bye, Mina! God bless and keep you.\n\n\n_Dr. Seward's Diary._\n\n_5 November._--With the dawn we saw the body of Szgany before us dashing\naway from the river with their leiter-wagon. They surrounded it in a\ncluster, and hurried along as though beset. The snow is falling lightly\nand there is a strange excitement in the air. It may be our own\nfeelings, but the depression is strange. Far off I hear the howling of\nwolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains, and there are\ndangers to all of us, and from all sides. The horses are nearly ready,\nand we are soon off. We ride to death of some one. God alone knows who,\nor where, or what, or when, or how it may be....\n\n\n_Dr. Van Helsing's Memorandum._\n\n_5 November, afternoon._--I am at least sane. Thank God for that mercy\nat all events, though the proving it has been dreadful. When I left\nMadam Mina sleeping within the Holy circle, I took my way to the castle.\nThe blacksmith hammer which I took in the carriage from Veresti was\nuseful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty\nhinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that\nbeing entered I might not get out. Jonathan's bitter experience served\nme here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I\nknew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if\nthere was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy. Either\nthere was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.\nThen I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible plight.\nThe dilemma had me between his horns.\n\nHer, I had not dare to take into this place, but left safe from the\nVampire in that Holy circle; and yet even there would be the wolf! I\nresolve me that my work lay here, and that as to the wolves we must\nsubmit, if it were God's will. At any rate it was only death and\nfreedom beyond. So did I choose for her. Had it but been for myself the\nchoice had been easy, the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than\nthe grave of the Vampire! So I make my choice to go on with my work.\n\nI knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are\ninhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them. She lay in her\nVampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder as\nthough I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when\nsuch things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine,\nfound at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So he delay,\nand delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination of the\nwanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on and on, till sunset\ncome, and the Vampire sleep be over. Then the beautiful eyes of the fair\nwoman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth present to a\nkiss--and man is weak. And there remain one more victim in the Vampire\nfold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...\n\nThere is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence\nof such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and\nheavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such\nas the lairs of the Count have had. Yes, I was moved--I, Van Helsing,\nwith all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved to a\nyearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my\nvery soul. It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the\nstrange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it\nwas that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields\nto a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a\nlong, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound\nof a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.\n\nThen I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching\naway tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one. I dared not\npause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I should\nbegin to be enthrall; but I go on searching until, presently, I find in\na high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister\nwhich, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of\nthe mist. She was so fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so\nexquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls\nsome of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl\nwith new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam\nMina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought\nfurther upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had\nsearched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as\nthere had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms around us in the\nnight, I took it that there were no more of active Un-Dead existent.\nThere was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest; huge it was, and\nnobly proportioned. On it was but one word\n\n                                DRACULA.\n\nThis then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many more\nwere due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I knew.\nBefore I began to restore these women to their dead selves through my\nawful work, I laid in Dracula's tomb some of the Wafer, and so banished\nhim from it, Un-Dead, for ever.\n\nThen began my terrible task, and I dreaded it. Had it been but one, it\nhad been easy, comparative. But three! To begin twice more after I had\nbeen through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the sweet\nMiss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived\nthrough centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the\nyears; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....\n\nOh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by\nthoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of\nfear, I could not have gone on. I tremble and tremble even yet, though\ntill all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand. Had I not seen\nthe repose in the first place, and the gladness that stole over it just\nere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been\nwon, I could not have gone further with my butchery. I could not have\nendured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of\nwrithing form, and lips of bloody foam. I should have fled in terror and\nleft my work undone. But it is over! And the poor souls, I can pity them\nnow and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of death\nfor a short moment ere fading. For, friend John, hardly had my knife\nsevered the head of each, before the whole body began to melt away and\ncrumble in to its native dust, as though the death that should have come\ncenturies agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud \"I\nam here!\"\n\nBefore I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can\nthe Count enter there Un-Dead.\n\nWhen I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from her\nsleep, and, seeing, me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.\n\n\"Come!\" she said, \"come away from this awful place! Let us go to meet my\nhusband who is, I know, coming towards us.\" She was looking thin and\npale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour. I was\nglad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of the\nfresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep.\n\nAnd so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to meet\nour friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_ are\ncoming to meet us.\n\n\n_Mina Harker's Journal._\n\n_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I\ntook our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did\nnot go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take\nheavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being\nleft without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our\nprovisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we\ncould see through the snowfall, there was not even the sign of\nhabitation. When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the heavy\nwalking and sat down to rest. Then we looked back and saw where the\nclear line of Dracula's castle cut the sky; for we were so deep under\nthe hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the\nCarpathian mountains was far below it. We saw it in all its grandeur,\nperched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with\nseemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain\non any side. There was something wild and uncanny about the place. We\ncould hear the distant howling of wolves. They were far off, but the\nsound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was\nfull of terror. I knew from the way Dr. Van Helsing was searching about\nthat he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less\nexposed in case of attack. The rough roadway still led downwards; we\ncould trace it through the drifted snow.\n\nIn a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined\nhim. He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a rock,\nwith an entrance like a doorway between two boulders. He took me by the\nhand and drew me in: \"See!\" he said, \"here you will be in shelter; and\nif the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.\" He brought in our\nfurs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some provisions and\nforced them upon me. But I could not eat; to even try to do so was\nrepulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please him, I could\nnot bring myself to the attempt. He looked very sad, but did not\nreproach me. Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood on the top\nof the rock, and began to search the horizon. Suddenly he called out:--\n\n\"Look! Madam Mina, look! look!\" I sprang up and stood beside him on the\nrock; he handed me his glasses and pointed. The snow was now falling\nmore heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning\nto blow. However, there were times when there were pauses between the\nsnow flurries and I could see a long way round. From the height where we\nwere it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the\nwhite waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in\nkinks and curls as it wound its way. Straight in front of us and not far\noff--in fact, so near that I wondered we had not noticed before--came a\ngroup of mounted men hurrying along. In the midst of them was a cart, a\nlong leiter-wagon which swept from side to side, like a dog's tail\nwagging, with each stern inequality of the road. Outlined against the\nsnow as they were, I could see from the men's clothes that they were\npeasants or gypsies of some kind.\n\nOn the cart was a great square chest. My heart leaped as I saw it, for I\nfelt that the end was coming. The evening was now drawing close, and\nwell I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned\nthere, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all\npursuit. In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,\nhowever, he was not there. An instant later, I saw him below me. Round\nthe rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last\nnight. When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--\n\n\"At least you shall be safe here from _him_!\" He took the glasses from\nme, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.\n\"See,\" he said, \"they come quickly; they are flogging the horses, and\ngalloping as hard as they can.\" He paused and went on in a hollow\nvoice:--\n\n\"They are racing for the sunset. We may be too late. God's will be\ndone!\" Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole\nlandscape was blotted out. It soon passed, however, and once more his\nglasses were fixed on the plain. Then came a sudden cry:--\n\n\"Look! Look! Look! See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the\nsouth. It must be Quincey and John. Take the glass. Look before the snow\nblots it all out!\" I took it and looked. The two men might be Dr. Seward\nand Mr. Morris. I knew at all events that neither of them was Jonathan.\nAt the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off; looking around\nI saw on the north side of the coming party two other men, riding at\nbreak-neck speed. One of them I knew was Jonathan, and the other I took,\nof course, to be Lord Godalming. They, too, were pursuing the party with\nthe cart. When I told the Professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy,\nand, after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible, he\nlaid his Winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the\nopening of our shelter. \"They are all converging,\" he said. \"When the\ntime comes we shall have gypsies on all sides.\" I got out my revolver\nready to hand, for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came\nlouder and closer. When the snow storm abated a moment we looked again.\nIt was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us,\nand beyond, the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down\ntowards the far mountain tops. Sweeping the glass all around us I could\nsee here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger\nnumbers--the wolves were gathering for their prey.\n\nEvery instant seemed an age whilst we waited. The wind came now in\nfierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in\ncircling eddies. At times we could not see an arm's length before us;\nbut at others, as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to\nclear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off. We had of\nlate been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew\nwith fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the\nsun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less\nthan an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various\nbodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer\nand more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly\nhad driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts,\nthe snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each\nparty, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did\nnot seem to realise, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they\nseemed, however, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower\nand lower on the mountain tops.\n\nCloser and closer they drew. The Professor and I crouched down behind\nour rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was determined\nthat they should not pass. One and all were quite unaware of our\npresence.\n\nAll at once two voices shouted out to: \"Halt!\" One was my Jonathan's,\nraised in a high key of passion; the other Mr. Morris' strong resolute\ntone of quiet command. The gypsies may not have known the language, but\nthere was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were\nspoken. Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming\nand Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris on the\nother. The leader of the gypsies, a splendid-looking fellow who sat his\nhorse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave to his\ncompanions some word to proceed. They lashed the horses which sprang\nforward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and in an\nunmistakable way commanded them to stop. At the same moment Dr. Van\nHelsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.\nSeeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew\nup. The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the\ngypsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and held\nhimself in readiness to attack. Issue was joined in an instant.\n\nThe leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out in\nfront, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the hill\ntops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not understand.\nFor answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses\nand dashed towards the cart. I should have felt terrible fear at seeing\nJonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of battle must have been\nupon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no fear, but only a wild,\nsurging desire to do something. Seeing the quick movement of our\nparties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command; his men instantly\nformed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one\nshouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the\norder.\n\nIn the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring\nof men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was\nevident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun\nshould set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the\nlevelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor\nthe howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their\nattention. Jonathan's impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his\npurpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they\ncowered, aside and let him pass. In an instant he had jumped upon the\ncart, and, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great\nbox, and flung it over the wheel to the ground. In the meantime, Mr.\nMorris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of\nSzgany. All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had,\nwith the tail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had\nseen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them, and\nthey cut at him. He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first\nI thought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang\nbeside Jonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that\nwith his left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was\nspurting through his fingers. He did not delay notwithstanding this, for\nas Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,\nattempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife, he attacked\nthe other frantically with his bowie. Under the efforts of both men the\nlid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and\nthe top of the box was thrown back.\n\nBy this time the gypsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,\nand at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr. Seward, had given in and made\nno resistance. The sun was almost down on the mountain tops, and the\nshadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow. I saw the Count\nlying within the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from\nthe cart had scattered over him. He was deathly pale, just like a waxen\nimage, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I\nknew too well.\n\nAs I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them\nturned to triumph.\n\nBut, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan's great knife.\nI shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the same\nmoment Mr. Morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart.\n\nIt was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the\ndrawing of a breath, the whole body crumble into dust and passed from\nour sight.\n\nI shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final\ndissolution, there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never\ncould have imagined might have rested there.\n\nThe Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone\nof its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the\nsetting sun.\n\nThe gypsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary\ndisappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away as\nif for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the\nleiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves,\nwhich had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving\nus alone.\n\nMr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his\nhand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I\nflew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the\ntwo doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his\nhead on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand\nin that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of\nmy heart in my face, for he smiled at me and said:--\n\n\"I am only too happy to have been of any service! Oh, God!\" he cried\nsuddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, \"It was\nworth for this to die! Look! look!\"\n\nThe sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams\nfell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light. With one impulse\nthe men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest \"Amen\" broke from all\nas their eyes followed the pointing of his finger. The dying man\nspoke:--\n\n\"Now God be thanked that all has not been in vain! See! the snow is not\nmore stainless than her forehead! The curse has passed away!\"\n\nAnd, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a\ngallant gentleman.\n\n\n\n\n                                  NOTE\n\n\nSeven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of\nsome of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured. It\nis an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy's birthday is the same\nday as that on which Quincey Morris died. His mother holds, I know, the\nsecret belief that some of our brave friend's spirit has passed into\nhim. His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but\nwe call him Quincey.\n\nIn the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went\nover the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and\nterrible memories. It was almost impossible to believe that the things\nwhich we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were\nliving truths. Every trace of all that had been was blotted out. The\ncastle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.\n\nWhen we got home we were talking of the old time--which we could all\nlook back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily\nmarried. I took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since\nour return so long ago. We were struck with the fact, that in all the\nmass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly one\nauthentic document; nothing but a mass of typewriting, except the later\nnote-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing's memorandum.\nWe could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept these as\nproofs of so wild a story. Van Helsing summed it all up as he said, with\nour boy on his knee:--\n\n\"We want no proofs; we ask none to believe us! This boy will some day\nknow what a brave and gallant woman his mother is. Already he knows her\nsweetness and loving care; later on he will understand how some men so\nloved her, that they did dare much for her sake.\"\n\nJONATHAN HARKER.\n\n                                THE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                       _There's More to Follow!_\n\n     More stories of the sort you like; more, probably, by the author of\n     this one; more than 500 titles all told by writers of world-wide\n     reputation, in the Authors' Alphabetical List which you will find\n     on the _reverse side_ of the wrapper of this book.
