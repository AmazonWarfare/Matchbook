{"genre": ["Fantasy"], "text": ["\nnding beside him in the white hallway. \u201cLast conflict of the Manywar.\u201d\n\nLightsong nodded. He\u2019d known that, somehow. The faces of many of the soldiers were tinged with grey. They were Lifeless. The Manywar had been the first time they had been used in large numbers on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t prefer war scenes,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d \u201cI like it,\u201d Lightsong said, cutting off the priest. \u201cI like it a lot.\u201d Llarimar fell silent.\n\nLightsong stared into the painting with its flowing reds, painted so subtly that they gave afeeling of war, rather than just an image. \u201cIt might be the best painting that has ever passed through my hall.\u201d\n\nThe priests on the other side of the room began writing furiously. Llarimar just stared at him, troubled.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lightsong asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Llarimar said.\n\n\u201cScoot . . .\u201d Lightsong said, eyeing him.\n\nThe priest sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t speak, Your Grace. I cannot taint your impression of the paintings.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of gods have been giving favorable reviews of war paintings lately, eh?\u201d Lightsong said, looking back at the artwork.\n\nLlarimar didn\u2019t answer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cJust our response to those arguments in the court, I\u2019d guess.\u201d \u201cLikely,\u201d Llarimar said.\n\nLightsong fell silent. He knew it wasn\u2019t \u201cnothing\u201d to Llarimar. To him, Lightsong wasn\u2019t just giving his impression of art\u2014he was foretelling the future. What did it augur that he liked a depiction of war with\nsuch vibrant, brutal colorings? Was it a reaction to his dreams? But last night, he hadn\u2019t dreamed of a war. Finally. He\u2019d dreamed of a storm, true, but that wasn\u2019t the same thing.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have spoken, he thought. And yet, reacting to the art seemed like the only truly important thing he did.\n\nHe stared at the sharp smears of paint, each figure a just a couple of triangular strokes. It was beautiful. Could war be beautiful? How could he find beauty in those grey faces confronting flesh, the Lifeless killing men? This battle hadn\u2019t even meant anything. It hadn\u2019t decided the outcome of the war, even though the leader of the Pahn Unity\u2014the kingdoms united against Hallandren\u2014had been killed in the battle. Diplomacy had finally ended the Manywar, not bloodshed.\n\nAre we thinking of starting this up again? Lightsong thought, still transfixed by the beauty.Is what I do going to lead to war?\n\nNo, he thought to himself. No, I\u2019m just being careful. Helping Blushweaver secure a political faction. Better that than letting things just pass me by. The Manywar started because the royal family wasn\u2019t careful.\n\nThe painting continued to call to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that sword?\u201d Lightsong asked.\n\n\u201cSword?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe black one,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cIn the woman\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t see a sword, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I don\u2019t see a woman, either. It\u2019s all just wild strokes of paint, to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou called it the Battle of Twilight Falls.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe title of the piece, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cI assumed that you were as confused by it as I was, so I told you what the artist had named it.\u201d\n\nThe two fell silent. Finally, Lightsong turned, walking away from the painting. \u201cI\u2019m done reviewing art for the day.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cDon\u2019t burn that painting. Keep it for my collection.\u201d\n\nLlarimar acknowledge the command with a nod. As Lightsong made his way out of the palace, he tried to regain some of his eagerness, and he succeeded\u2014though memory of the terrible, beautiful scene stayed with him. Mixing with his memories of last night\u2019s dream, with its clashing tempest of winds.\n\nNot even that could dampen his mood. Something was different. Something excited him. There had been a murder in the Court of Gods.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know why he should find that so intriguing. If anything, he should find it tragic or upsetting. And yet for as long as he had lived, everything had been provided for him. Answers to his questions, entertainment to sate his whims. Almost by accident, he had become a glutton. Only two things had been withheld from him: knowledge of his past and freedom to leave the court.\n\nNeither of those restrictions was going to change soon. But here, inside the court\u2014the place of too much safety and comfort\u2014something had gone wrong. A little thing. A thing most Returned would ignore. Nobody cared. Nobody wanted to care. Who, therefore, would object to Lightsong\u2019s questions?\n\u201cYou\u2019re acting very oddly, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said, catching up to him as they crossed the grass, servants following behind in a chaotic cluster as they worked to get a large red parasol open.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cHowever, I believe we can agree that I have always been rather odd, for a god.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must admit that is true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019m actually being very like myself,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cAnd all is right in the universe.\u201d \u201cAre we really going back to Mercystar\u2019s palace?\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed we are. Do you suppose she\u2019ll be annoyed at us? That might prove interesting.\u201d Llarimar just sighed. \u201cAre you ready to talk about your dreams yet?\u201d\n\nLightsong did not immediately reply. The servants finally got the parasol up and held it over him. \u201cI dreamed of a storm,\u201d Lightsong finally said. \u201cI was standing in it, without anything to brace myself. It was raining and blowing against me, forcing me backward. In fact, it was so strong that even the ground beneath me seemed to undulate.\u201d\n\nLlarimar looked disturbed.\n\nMore signs of war, Lightsong thought. Or, at least, that\u2019s how he\u2019ll see it.\n\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cA red panther. It seemed to shine, reflective, like it was made of glass or something like that. It was waiting in the storm.\u201d\n\nLlarimar eyed him. \u201cAre you making things up, Your Grace?\u201d \u201cWhat? No! That\u2019s really what I dreamed.\u201d\n\nLlarimar sighed, but nodded to a lesser priest, who rushed up to take his dictation. It wasn\u2019t long before they reached Mercystar\u2019s palace of yellow and gold. Lightsong paused before the building, realizing that he\u2019d never before visited another god\u2019s palace without first sending a messenger.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to send in someone to announce you, Your Grace?\u201d Llarimar asked.\n\nLightsong hesitated. \u201cNo,\u201d he finally said, noticing a pair of guards standing at the main doorway. The two men looked far more muscular than the average servant and they wore swords. Dueling blades, Lightsong assumed\u2014though he\u2019d never actually seen one.\n\nHe walked up to the men. \u201cIs your mistress here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid not, Your Grace,\u201d one of them said. \u201cShe went to visit Allmother for the afternoon.\u201d\n\nAllmother, Lightsong thought. Another with Lifeless Commands. Blushweaver\u2019s doing?Perhaps he would drop by later\u2014he missed chatting with Allmother. She, unfortunately, hated him violently. \u201cAh,\u201d Lightsong said to the guard. \u201cWell, regardless, I need to inspect the corridor just inside here, where the attack happened the other night.\u201d\n\nThe guards glanced at each other. \u201cI . . . don\u2019t know if we can let you do that, Your Grace.\u201d\n\u201cScoot!\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cCan they forbid me?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly if they have a direct command to do so from Mercystar.\u201d\n\nLightsong looked back at the men. Reluctantly, they stepped aside. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly all right,\u201d he told them. \u201cShe asked me to take care of things. Kind of. Coming, Scoot?\u201d\n\nLlarimar followed him into the corridors. Once again, Lightsong felt an odd satisfaction. Instincts he hadn\u2019t known he had drove him to seek out the place where the servant had died.\n\nThe wood had been replaced\u2014his Heightened eyes could easily tell the difference between the new wood and the old. He walked a little farther. The patch where the wood had turned grey was gone as well, seamlessly replaced with new material.\n\nInteresting, he thought. But not unexpected. I wonder . . . are there any other patches?He walked a little further and was rewarded by another patch of new wood. It formed an exact square.\n\n\u201cYour Grace?\u201d a new voice asked.\n\nLightsong looked up to see the curt young priest he had spoken with the day before. Lightsong smiled. \u201cAh, good. I was hoping that you would come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is most irregular, Your Grace,\u201d the man said.\n\n\u201cI hear that eating a lot of figs can cure you of that,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cNow, I need to speak with the guards who saw the intruder the other night.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why, Your Grace?\u201d the priest said.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m eccentric,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cSend for them. I need to speak to all of the servants or guards who saw the man who committed the murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Grace,\u201d the priest said uncomfortably. \u201cThe city authorities have already dealt with this. They have determined that the intruder was a thief after Mercystar\u2019s art, and they have committed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cScoot,\u201d Lightsong said, turning. \u201cCan this man ignore my demand?\u201d \u201cOnly at great peril to his soul, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said.\n\nThe priest eyed them both angrily, then turned and sent a servant to do as Lightsong asked. Lightsong knelt down, causing several servants to whisper in alarm. They obviously thought it improper for a god to stoop.\n\nLightsong ignored them, looking at the square of new wood. It was larger than the other two that had been ripped up, and the colors matched far better. It was just a square patch of wood that was just\na slightly different color than its neighbors. Without Breath\u2014and a lot of it\u2014he wouldn\u2019t even have noticed the distinction.\n\nA trapdoor, he thought with sudden shock. The priest was watching him closely. This patch isn\u2019t as new as the other ones back there. It\u2019s only new in relation to the other boards.\nLightsong crawled along the floor, deliberately ignoring the door in the floor. Once again, unexpected instincts warned him not to reveal what he\u2019d discovered. Why was he so wary all of a sudden? Was it the influence of his violent dreams and imagery from the painting earlier? Or was it something more? He felt as if he were dredging deep within himself, pulling forth an awareness he had never before needed.\n\nEither way, he moved on from the patch, pretending that he hadn\u2019t noticed the trapdoor, and was instead searching for threads that might have been caught on the wood. He picked up one that had obviously come from a servant\u2019s robe and held it up.\n\nThe priest seemed to relax slightly.\n\nSo he knows about the trapdoor, Lightsong thought. And . . . perhaps the intruder did as well?\n\nLightsong crawled some more, discomforting the servants until the men he had requested were assembled. He stood\u2014letting a couple of his servants dust off his robes\u2014then walked over to the newcomers. The hallway was growing quite crowded, so he shooed them back out into the sunlight.\n\nOutside, he regarded the group of six men. \u201cIdentify yourselves. You on the left, who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Gagaril,\u201d the man said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Lightsong said.\n\nThe man flushed. \u201cI was named after my father, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter he what? Spent an unusual amount of time at the local tavern? Anyway, how are you involved in this mess?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was one of the guards at the door when the intruder broke in.\u201d \u201cWere you alone?\u201d Lightsong asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said another of the men. \u201cI was with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cYou two, go over there somewhere.\u201d He waved his hand at the lawn. The men looked at each other, then walked away as indicated.\n\n\u201cFar enough that you can\u2019t hear us!\u201d Lightsong called at them.\n\nThe men nodded and continued.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Lightsong said, looking back at the others. \u201cWho are you four?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were attacked by the man in the hallway,\u201d one of the servants said. He pointed at two of the others. \u201cAll three of us. And . . . one other. The man who was killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerribly unfortunate, that,\u201d Lightsong said, pointing at another section of the lawn. \u201cOff you go. Walk until you can\u2019t hear me anymore, then wait.\u201d\n\nThe three men trudged off.\n\n\u201cAnd now you,\u201d Lightsong said, hands on hips, regarding the last man\u2014a shorter priest.\n\u201cI saw the intruder flee, Your Grace,\u201d the priest said. \u201cI was watching out a window.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery timely of you,\u201d Lightsong said, pointing at a third spot on the lawn, far enough from the others to be sequestered. The man walked away. Lightsong turned back to the priest who was obviously in charge.\n\n\u201cYou said that the intruder released a Lifeless animal?\u201d Lightsong asked.\n\n\u201cA squirrel, Your Grace,\u201d the priest said. \u201cWe captured it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo and fetch it for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Grace, it\u2019s quite wild and\u2014\u201d He stopped, recognizing the look in Lightsong\u2019s eyes, then waved for a servant.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cNot a servant. You go and get it personally.\u201d The priest looked incredulous.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Lightsong said, waving him away. \u201cI know. It\u2019s an offense to your dignity. Perhaps you should think about converting to Austrism. For now, get going.\u201d\n\nThe priest left, grumbling.\n\n\u201cThe rest of you,\u201d Lightsong said, addressing his own servants and priests. \u201cYou wait here.\u201d They looked resigned. Perhaps they were growing accustomed to him dismissing them.\n\u201cCome on, Scoot,\u201d Lightsong said, walking toward the first group he had sent off onto the lawn\u2014the two guards. Llarimar scurried forward to keep up as Lightsong took long strides over to the two men. \u201cNow,\u201d Lightsong said to the two, out of earshot of the others, \u201ctell me what you saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe came to us pretending to be a madman, Your Grace,\u201d one of the guards said. \u201cHe sauntered out of the shadows, mumbling to himself. It was just an act, though, and when he got close enough, he knocked us both out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Lightsong asked.\n\n\u201cHe grabbed me around the neck with tassels from his Awakened coat,\u201d one of the men said. He nodded to his companion. \u201cKnocked him in the stomach with the hilt of a sword.\u201d\n\nThe second guard raised his shirt to show a large bruise on his stomach, then cocked his head to the side, showing another one on his neck.\n\n\u201cChoked us both,\u201d the first guard said. \u201cMe with those tassels, Fran with a boot on his neck. That\u2019s the last thing we knew. By the time we awoke, he was gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe choked you,\u201d Lightsong said, \u201cbut didn\u2019t kill you. Just enough to knock you out?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Your Grace,\u201d the guard said.\n\n\u201cPlease describe this man,\u201d Lightsong said.\n\n\u201cHe was big,\u201d the guard said. \u201cHad a scraggly beard. Not too long, but not trimmed either.\u201d\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t smelly or dirty,\u201d the other said. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t seem to take much care for how he looked. His hair was long\u2014came down to his neck\u2014and hadn\u2019t seen a brush in a long while.\u201d\n\n\u201cWore ragged clothing,\u201d the first said. \u201cPatched in places, nothing bright, but not really dark either. Just kind of . . . bland. Rather un-Hallandren, now that I think on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he was armed?\u201d Lightsong said.\n\n\u201cWith the sword that hit me,\u201d the second guard said. \u201cBig thing. Not a dueling blade, more like an Easterner sword. Straight and really long. Had it hidden under his cloak, and we would have seen it, if he hadn\u2019t covered it up by walking so oddly.\u201d\n\nLightsong nodded. \u201cThank you. Stay here.\u201d\n\nWith that, he turned and walked toward the second group.\n\n\u201cThis is very interesting, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t see the point.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just curious,\u201d Lightsong said.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not really the curious type.\u201d\n\nLightsong continued walking. The things he was doing, he did mostly without thinking. They just felt natural. He approached the next group. \u201cYou were the ones who saw the intruder in the hallway, right?\u201d Lightsong said to them.\n\nThe men nodded. One shot a glance back at Mercystar\u2019s palace. The lawn in front of it was now crowded with a colorful assortment of priests and servants, both Mercystar\u2019s and Lightsong\u2019s own.\n\n\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d Lightsong said.\n\n\u201cWe were walking through the servants\u2019 hallway,\u201d one said. \u201cWe\u2019d been released for the evening, and were going to go out into the city to a nearby tavern.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we saw someone in the hallway,\u201d another said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t belong there.\u201d \u201cDescribe him,\u201d Lightsong said.\n\n\u201cBig man,\u201d one said. The others nodded. \u201cHad ragged clothing and a beard. Kind of dirty-looking.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d another said. \u201cThe clothing was old, but the man wasn\u2019t dirty. Just slovenly.\u201d Lightsong nodded. \u201cContinue.\u201d\n\u201cWell, there isn\u2019t much to say,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cHe attacked us. Threw an Awakened rope at poor Taff, who got tied up immediately. Rariv and I ran for help. Lolan stayed behind.\u201d\n\nLightsong looked at the third man. \u201cYou stayed back? Why?\u201d \u201cTo help Taff, of course,\u201d the man said.\n\nLying, Lightsong thought. Looks too nervous. \u201cReally?\u201d he said, stepping closer.\n\nThe man looked down. \u201cWell, mostly. I mean, there was the sword, too . . .\u201d\n\u201cOh, right,\u201d another said. \u201cHe threw a sword at us. Strangest thing.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t draw it?\u201d Lightsong asked. \u201cHe threw it?\u201d\n\nThe men shook their heads. \u201cHe threw it at us, sheath and all. Lolan picked it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d fight him,\u201d Lolan said.\n\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cSo you two left?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cWhen we came back with the others\u2014after getting around that blasted squirrel\u2014we found Lolan on the ground, unconscious, and poor Taff . . . well, he was still tied up, though the rope wasn\u2019t Awakened anymore. He\u2019d been stabbed straight through.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw him die?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lolan said, bringing his hands up in denial. He had\u2014Lightsong noticed\u2014a bandage on one hand. \u201cThe intruder knocked me out with a fist to the head.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you had the sword,\u201d Lightsong said.\n\n\u201cIt was too big to use,\u201d the man said, looking down.\n\n\u201cSo he threw the sword at you, then ran up and punched you?\u201d Lightsong said.\n\nThe man nodded.\n\n\u201cAnd your hand?\u201d Lightsong asked.\n\nThe man paused, unconsciously retracting his hand. \u201cIt got twisted. Nothing important.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you need a bandage for a twisted wrist?\u201d Lightsong said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cShow me.\u201d The man hesitated.\n\n\u201cShow me, or lose your soul, my son,\u201d Lightsong said in what he hoped was a suitably divine voice.\n\nThe man slowly extended his hand. Llarimar stepped forward and removed the bandage.\n\nThe hand was completely grey, drained of color.\n\nImpossible, Lightsong thought with shock. Awakening doesn\u2019t do that to living flesh. It can\u2019t draw color from someone alive, only objects. Floorboards, clothing, furniture.\n\nThe man withdrew his hand.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Lightsong asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the man said. \u201cI woke up, and it was like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Lightsong said flatly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m to believe that you had nothing else to do with this? That you weren\u2019t working with the intruder?\u201d\n\nThe man fell to his knees suddenly, beginning to cry. \u201cPlease, my lord! Don\u2019t take my soul. I\u2019m not the best of men. I go to the brothels. I cheat when we gamble.\u201d\nThe other two looked startled at this.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t know anything about this intruder,\u201d Lolan continued. \u201cPlease, you have to believe me. I just wanted that sword. That beautiful, black sword! I wanted to draw it, swing it, attack the man with it. I reached for it and while I was distracted, he attacked me. But I didn\u2019t see him kill Taff! I promise, I hadn\u2019t ever seen this intruder before! You have to believe me!\u201d\n\nLightsong paused. \u201cI do,\u201d he finally said. \u201cLet this be a warning. Be good. Stop cheating.\u201d \u201cYes, my lord.\u201d\n\nLightsong nodded to the men, then he and Llarimar left them behind.\n\n\u201cI actually kind of feel like a god,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cDid you see me make that man repent?\u201d \u201cAmazing, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said.\n\n\u201cSo what do you think about their testimonies?\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cSomething strange is going on, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still wondering why you think you should be the one to investigate it, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I have anything else to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides be a god.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverrated,\u201d Lightsong said, walking up to the final man. \u201cIt has nice perks, but the hours are awful.\u201d\n\nLlarimar snorted quietly as Lightsong turned to address the final witness, the short priest who stood in his robes of yellow and gold. He was distinctly younger than the other priest.\n\nWas he chosen to tell me lies with the hopes that he\u2019d seem innocent? Lightsong wondered idly. Or am I just making assumptions? \u201cWhat is your story?\u201d Lightsong asked.\n\nThe young priest bowed. \u201cI was going about my duties, carrying to the records sanctuary several prophecies we had inscribed from the Lady\u2019s mouth. I heard a distant disturbance in the building. I looked out the window toward the sound, but I saw nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Lightsong asked.\n\nThe young man pointed toward a window. \u201cThere, Your Grace.\u201d\n\nLightsong frowned. The priest had been on the opposite side of the palace from where the killing had occurred. However, that was the side of the building where the intruder had first entered. \u201cYou could see the doorway where the intruder disabled the two guards?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Your Grace,\u201d the man said. \u201cThough I didn\u2019t see them at first. I almost left the window to search for the source of the noise. However, at that point I did see something odd in the lantern light of the entryway: a figure moving. It was then that I noticed the guards on the ground. I thought they were dead bodies, and I was frightened by the shadowy figure moving between them. I yelled, and ran for help. By the time anyone paid attention to me, the figure was gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou went down to look for him?\u201d Lightsong asked.\nThe man nodded.\n\n\u201cAnd how long did it take you?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral minutes, Your Grace.\u201d\n\nLightsong nodded slowly. \u201cVery well, then. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThe young priest began to walk over to the main group of his colleagues.\n\n\u201cOh, wait,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cDid you, by any chance, get a clean look at the intruder?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really, Your Grace,\u201d the priest said. \u201cHe was in dark clothing, kind of nondescript. It was too far away to see well.\u201d\n\nLightsong waved the man away. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully for a moment, then eyed Llarimar. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\nThe priest raised an eyebrow. \u201cWell what, Your Grace?\u201d \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\nLlarimar shook his head. \u201cI . . . honestly don\u2019t know, Your Grace. This is obviously important, however.\u201d\n\nLightsong paused. \u201cIt is?\u201d\n\nLlarimar nodded. \u201cYes, Your Grace. Because of what that man said\u2014the one who was wounded in the hand. He mentioned a black sword. You predicted it, remember? In the painting this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t a prediction,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cThat was really there, in the painting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way prophecy works, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? You look at a painting and an entire image appears to your eyes. All I see is random strokes of red. The scene you describe\u2014 the things you see\u2014are prophetic. You are a god.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I saw exactly what the painting was said to depict!\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cBefore you even told me what the title was!\u201d\n\nLlarimar nodded knowingly, as if that proved his point.\n\n\u201cOh, never mind. Priests! Insufferable fanatics, every one of you. Either way, you agree with me that there is something strange here.\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cThen you\u2019ll kindly stop complaining when I investigate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said, \u201cit\u2019s even more imperative that you not get involved. You predicted this would occur, but you are an oracle. You must not interact with the subject of your predictions. If you get involved, you could unbalance a great many things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like being unbalanced,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cBesides, this is far too much fun.\u201d\nAs usual, Llarimar didn\u2019t react to having his advice ignored. As they began to walk back toward the main group, however, the priest did ask a question. \u201cYour Grace. Just to sate my own curiosity, what do you think about the murder?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious,\u201d Lightsong said idly. \u201cThere were two intruders. The first is the large man with the sword \u2014he knocked out the guards, attacked those servants, released the Lifeless, then disappeared. The second man\u2014the one the young priest saw\u2014came in after the first intruder. That second man is the murderer.\u201d\n\nLlarimar frowned. \u201cWhy do you suppose that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first man took care not to kill,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cHe left the guards alive at risk to himself, since they could have regained consciousness at any moment to raise the alarm. He didn\u2019t draw his sword against the servants but simply tried to subdue them. There was no reason for him to kill a bound captive\u2014particularly since he\u2019d already left witnesses. If there were a second man, however . . . well, that would make sense. The servant who was killed, he was the one who was conscious when this second intruder came through. That servant was the only one who saw the second intruder.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you think someone else followed the man with the sword, killed the only witness, and then . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth of them vanished,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cI found a trapdoor. I\u2019m thinking there must be passages beneath the palace. It all seems fairly obvious to me. One thing, however, is notobvious.\u201d He glanced at Llarimar, slowing before they reached the main group of priests and servants.\n\n\u201cAnd what is that, Your Grace?\u201d Llarimar asked.\n\n\u201cHow in the name of the Colors I figured all of this out!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying to grasp that myself, Your Grace.\u201d\n\nLightsong shook his head. \u201cThis comes from before, Scoot. Everything I\u2019m doing, it feelsnatural. Who was I before I died?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said, turning away.\n\n\u201cOh, come now, Scoot. I\u2019ve spent most of my Returned life just lounging about, but then\n\nthemoment someone is killed, I leap out of bed and can\u2019t resist poking around. Doesn\u2019t that sound suspicious to you?\u201d\n\nLlarimar didn\u2019t look at him.\n\n\u201cColors!\u201d Lightsong swore. \u201cI was someone useful? I was just beginning to convince myself that I\u2019d died in a reasonable way\u2014such as falling off a stump when I was drunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know you died in a brave way, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could have been a really high stump.\u201d\n\nLlarimar just shook his head. \u201cEither way, Your Grace, you know I can\u2019t say anything about who you were before.\u201d\n\u201cWell, these instincts came from somewhere,\u201d Lightsong said as they walked over to the main group of watching priests and servants. The head priest had returned with a small wooden box. Wild scratching came from inside. \u201cThank you,\u201d Lightsong snapped, grabbing the box and passing by without even breaking stride. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, Scoot, I am not pleased.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seemed rather happy this morning, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar noted as they walked away from Mercystar\u2019s palace. Her priest was left behind, a complaint dying on his lips, Lightsong\u2019s entourage trailing after their god.\n\n\u201cI was happy,\u201d Lightsong said, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t know what was going on. How am I going to be properly indolent if I keep itching to investigate things? Honestly, this murder will completely destroy my hard-won reputation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sympathies, Your Grace, that you have been inconvenienced by a semblance of motivation.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite right,\u201d Lightsong said, sighing. He handed over the box with its furious Lifeless rodent. \u201cHere. You think my Awakeners can break its security phrase?\u201d\n\n\u201cEventually,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cThough it\u2019s an animal, Your Grace. It won\u2019t be able to tell us anything directly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave them do it anyway,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cMeanwhile, I need to think about this case some more.\u201d\n\nThey walked back to his palace. However, the thing that now struck Lightsong was the fact that he\u2019d used the word \u201ccase\u201d in reference to the murder. It was a word he\u2019d never heard used in that particular context. Yet he knew that it fit. Instinctively, automatically.\n\nI didn\u2019t have to learn to speak again when I Returned, he thought. I didn\u2019t have to learn to walk again, or read again, or anything like that. Only my personal memory was lost.\n\nBut not all of it, apparently.\n"], "title": ["Warbreaker"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson"]}
