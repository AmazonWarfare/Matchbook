Don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe . . . don\u2019t have many grapes in Idris, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rather the opposite, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cFluffy and pretty on the outside, without much of import on the inside. But I guess that is beside the point. You, my dear, are a very welcome sight. Much more so than a grape.\u201d\n\n\u201cI . . . How is that, Your Grace?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a queen in such a long time,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cSince before my Return, in fact. And old Susebron up there really has been moping about the palace lately. Looking forlorn. It\u2019s good he has a woman in his life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for the compliment, Your Grace,\u201d the queen said. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019ll make up a few more, if you like.\u201d She fell silent.\n\nWell, then, that\u2019s it, he thought, sighing. Blushweaver was right. I probably shouldn\u2019t have come.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d the queen said, hair suddenly turning red as she threw her hands up in the air. \u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d\n\nHe hesitated. \u201cYour Majesty?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you making fun of me?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re supposed to be a god!\u201d she said, leaning back, staring up at the canopy. \u201cJust when I thought things in this city were starting to make sense, the priests start yelling at me, then you come along! What am I supposed to do with you? You seem more like a schoolboy than a god!\u201d\nLightsong paused, then settled back into his seat, smiling. \u201cYou have me found out,\u201d he said, opening his hands. \u201cI killed the real god and took his place. I\u2019ve come to hold you ransom for your sweets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d the queen said, pointing. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be . . . I don\u2019t know, distinguished or something?\u201d\n\nHe spread his hands out. \u201cMy dear, this is what passes for being distinguished in Hallandren.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem convinced.\n\n\u201cI am, of course, lying through my teeth,\u201d he said, eating another grape. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t base your opinion of the others upon what you think of me. They\u2019re all much more deific than I am.\u201d\n\nThe queen sat back. \u201cI thought you were the god of bravery.\u201d \u201cTechnically.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem more like the god of jesters to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve applied for the position and been turned down,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should see the person they have doing the job. Dull as a rock and twice as ugly.\u201d\n\nSiri hesitated.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t lying that time,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cMirthgiver, god of laughter. If ever there was a god more poorly suited to his position than I, it\u2019s he.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt appears there\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t understand in this city.\u201d\n\nThis woman is no fake, Lightsong thought, staring into her youthful, confused eyes. Or, if she is, then she\u2019s the best actress I\u2019ve ever met.\n\nThat meant something. Something important. It was possible there were mundane reasons this girl had been sent instead of her sister. Sickness on the part of the elder daughter, perhaps. But Lightsong didn\u2019t buy that. She was part of something. A plot, or perhaps several. And whatever those plots were, she didn\u2019t know about them.\n\nKalad\u2019s Phantoms! Lightsong cursed mentally. This child is going to get ripped apart and fed to the wolves!\n\nBut what could he really do about it? He sighed, standing, causing his priests to begin packing his things. The girl watched with confusion as he nodded to her, giving her a wan smile of farewell. She stood and curtsied slightly, though she probably didn\u2019t need to. She was his queen, even if she wasn\u2019t herself Returned.\n\nLightsong turned to go, then stopped, recalling his own first few months in the court, and the confusion he\u2019d known. He reached over, laying a gentle hand on her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t let them get to you, child,\u201d he whispered.\n\nAnd with that, he withdrew.\nVivenna walked back toward Lemex\u2019s house, dissecting the argument she\u2019d heard at the Court of Gods. Her tutors had instructed her that discussions in the Court Assembly didn\u2019t always lead to action; just because they talked of war didn\u2019t mean it would happen.\n\nThis discussion, however, seemed to mean more. It was too passionate, with too many voices for one side. It indicated that her father was right, and that war was inevitable.\n\nShe walked with her head down on a nearly deserted street. She was beginning to learn that she could avoid the roiling masses by walking through more residential sections of the city. It appeared that people in T\u2019Telir liked to be where everybody else was.\n\nThe street was in a wealthy neighborhood and had a slate stone sidewalk running along the side of it. It made for pleasant walking. Parlin walked beside her, occasionally pausing to study ferns or palm trees. The Hallandren liked plants; most of the homes were shaded by trees, vines, and exotic blooming shrubs. In Idris, each of the large homes along the street would have been considered a mansion, but here they were only of average size\u2014probably the homes of merchants.\n\nI need to stay focused, she thought. Is Hallandren going to attack soon? Or is this just a prelude to something still months, perhaps years, away?\n\nReal action wouldn\u2019t occur until the gods voted, and Vivenna wasn\u2019t sure what it would take to get them to that point. She shook her head. Only one day in T\u2019Telir, and already she knew that her training and tutorials hadn\u2019t prepared her half as well as she\u2019d assumed.\n\nShe felt as if she knew nothing. And that left her feeling very lost. She was not the confident, competent woman she\u2019d assumed herself to be. The frightening truth was, should she have been sent to become the God King\u2019s bride, she would have been nearly as in effec tive and confused as poor Siri undoubtedly was.\n\nThey turned a corner, Vivenna trusting in Parlin\u2019s amazing sense of direction to get them back to Lemex\u2019s house, and they passed under the gaze of one of the silent D\u2019Denir statues. The proud warrior stood with sword raised above his stone head, his armor\u2014carved into the statue\u2014augmented by a red scarf tied and flapping around his neck. He looked dramatic, as if he were going gloriously to war. It wasn\u2019t long before they approached the steps to Lemex\u2019s house. Vivenna froze, however, when she saw that the door was hanging from one hinge. The lower part was cracked, as if it had been kicked very hard.\n\nParlin pulled up beside her, then hissed, holding up a hand for her to be silent. His hand went to the long hunting knife at his belt and he glanced around. Vivenna stepped back, nerves itching to flee. And yet, where would she go? The mercenaries were her only connection in the city. Denth and Tonk Fah could have handled an attack, right?\n\nSomeone approached from the other side of the door. Her BioChromatic senses warned her of the proximity. She laid a hand on Parlin\u2019s arm, preparing to bolt.\n\nDenth pushed the broken door open, sticking his head out. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked. \u201cWere you attacked?\u201d\nDenth glanced at the door and chuckled to himself. \u201cNah,\u201d he said, pushing the door open and waving her in. Through the broken door she could see that furniture had been ripped apart, there were holes in the walls, and pictures were slashed and broken. Denth wandered back inside, kicking aside some stuffing from a cushion, making his way toward the stairs. Several of the steps had been broken.\n\nHe glanced back, noting her confusion. \u201cWell, we did say we were going to search the house, Princess. Figured we might as well do a good job of it.\u201d\n\n\n\nVivenna sat down very carefully, half-expecting the chair to collapse beneath her. Tonk Fah and Denth had been very thorough in their search\u2014they had broken every bit of wood in the house, it seemed, including chair legs. Fortunately, her current chair had been propped up reasonably well, and it held her weight.\n\nThe desk in front of her\u2014Lemex\u2019s desk\u2014was splintered. The drawers had been removed, and a false back had been revealed, the compartment emptied. A group of papers and several bags sat on the desktop.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s everything,\u201d Denth said, leaning against the room\u2019s doorframe. Tonk Fah lounged on a broken couch, its stuffing sticking out awkwardly.\n\n\u201cDid you have to break so much?\u201d Vivenna asked.\n\n\u201cHad to be certain,\u201d Denth said, shrugging. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised where people hide things.\u201d\n\n\u201cInside the front door?\u201d Vivenna asked flatly.\n\n\u201cWould you have thought to look there?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds like a pretty good hiding place to me, then. We knocked, and thought we found a hollow space. Just turned out to be a section of different wood, but it was important to check.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople get really clever when it comes to hiding important stuff,\u201d Tonk Fah said with a yawn.\n\n\u201cYou know the thing I hate most about being a mercenary?\u201d Denth asked, holding up a hand.\n\nVivenna raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cSplinters,\u201d he said, wiggling several red fingers.\n\n\u201cNo hazard pay for those,\u201d Tonk Fah added.\n\n\u201cOh, now you\u2019re just being silly,\u201d Vivenna said, sorting through the items on the table. One of the bags clinked suggestively. Vivenna undid the drawstring and pulled open the top.\n\nGold glistened inside. A lot of it.\n\n\u201cLittle over five thousand marks in there,\u201d Denth said lazily. \u201cLemex had it stashed all over the house. Found one bar of it in the leg of your chair.\u201d\n\u201cGot easier when we discovered the paper he\u2019d used to remind himself of where he hid it all,\u201d Tonk Fah noted.\n\n\u201cFive thousand marks?\u201d Vivenna said, feeling her hair lighten slightly in shock.\n\n\u201cSeems like old Lemex was storing up quite the little nest egg,\u201d Denth said, chuckling. \u201cThat, mixed with the amount of Breath he held . . . he must have extorted even more from Idris than I assumed.\u201d\n\nVivenna stared at the bag. Then, she looked up at Denth. \u201cYou . . . gave it to me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could have taken it and spent it!\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, we did,\u201d Denth said. \u201cTook about ten bits for lunch. Should be here any minute.\u201d Vivenna met his eyes.\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, eh, Tonks?\u201d Denth said, glancing down at the larger man. \u201cIf I\u2019d been, say, a butler, would she be looking at me like that? Just because I didn\u2019t take the money and run? Why does everyone expect a mercenary to rob them?\u201d\n\nTonk Fah grunted, stretching again.\n\n\u201cLook through those papers, Princess,\u201d Denth said, kicking Tonk Fah\u2019s couch, then nodding toward the door. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you downstairs.\u201d\n\nVivenna watched them retreat, Tonk Fah grumbling as he had to rise, bits of stuffing sticking to the back of his clothing. They thumped their way down the stairs, and soon she heard dishes rattling. They\u2019d likely sent one of the street boys\u2014who passed periodically yelling that they would bring food from a local restaurant\u2014for the meal.\n\nVivenna didn\u2019t move. She was increasingly uncertain of her purpose in the city. Yet she still had Denth and Tonk Fah, and\u2014surprisingly\u2014she was finding herself growing attached to them. How many soldiers in her father\u2019s army\u2014good men, all of them\u2014would have been able to resist running off with five thousand marks? There was more to these mercenaries than they let on.\n\nShe turned her attention to the books, letters, and papers on the desk.\n\n\n\nSeveral hours later, Vivenna still sat alone, a solitary candle burning and dripping wax onto the splintered desk corner. She had long since stopped reading. A plate of food sat uneaten by the door, brought by Parlin some time before.\n\nLetters lay spread out on the desk before her. It had taken time to put them in order. Most were penned in her father\u2019s familiar hand. Not the hand of her father\u2019s scribe. Her father\u2019s ownhand. That had been her first clue. He only wrote his most personal, or most secret, communications on his own.\n\nVivenna kept her hair under control. She deliberately breathed in and out. She didn\u2019t look out the darkened window at the lights of a city that should have been asleep. She simply sat.\n\nNumb.\n\nThe final letter\u2014the last before Lemex\u2019s death\u2014sat on top of the pile. It was only a few weeks old.\nMy friend, her father\u2019s script read.\n\nOur conversations have worried me more than I care to admit. I have spoken with Yarda at length. We can see no solution.\n\nWar is coming. We all know that now. The continued\u2014and increasingly vigorous\u2014arguments in the Court of Gods show a disturbing trend. The money we sent to buy you enough Breath to attend those meetings is some of the best I have ever spent.\n\nAll signs point to the inevitability of Hallandren Lifeless marching to our mountains. Therefore, I give you leave to do as we have discussed. Any disruptions you can cause in the city\u2014any delays you can earn us\u2014will be extremely valuable. The additional funds you requested should have arrived by now.\n\nMy friend, I must admit a weakness in myself. I will never be able to send Vivenna to be a hostage in that dragon\u2019s nest of a city. To send her would be to kill her, and I cannot do that. Even though I know it would be best for Idris if I did.\n\nI\u2019m not yet sure what I will do. I will not send her, for I love her too much. However, breaking the treaty would bring the Hallandren wrath against my people even more quickly. I fear I may have to make a very difficult decision in the days to come.\n\nBut that is the essence of a king\u2019s duty.\n\nUntil we correspond again,\n\nDedelin, your liege and your friend.\n\nVivenna looked away from the letter. The room was too perfectly silent. She wanted to scream at the letter and her father, who was now so far away. And yet, she could not. She had been trained for better. Tantrums were useless displays of arrogance.\n\nDon\u2019t draw attention to yourself. Don\u2019t set yourself above others. He who makes himself high will be cast down low. But what of the man who murders one of his daughters to save the other? What of the man who claims\u2014to your face\u2014that the switch was for other reasons? That it was for the good of Idris? That it wasn\u2019t about favoritism at all?\n\nWhat of the king who betrayed the highest tenets of his religion by purchasing Breath for one of his spies?\n\nVivenna blinked at a tear in her eye, then gritted her teeth, angry at herself and the world. Her father was supposed to be a good man. The perfect king. Wise and knowing, always sure of himself and always right.\n\nThe man she saw in these letters was far more human. Why should she be so shocked to learn that?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, she told herself. None of that matters. Factions in the Hallandren government were rallying the nation for war. Reading her father\u2019s candid words, she finally believed him completely. Hallandren troops would likely march on her homeland before the year was out. And then, the Hallandren\u2014so colorful yet so deceptive\u2014would hold Siri hostage and threaten to kill her unless Dedelin surrendered.\nHer father would not give up his kingdom. Siri would be executed.\n\nAnd that is what I\u2019m here to stop, Vivenna thought. Her hands grew tighter, gripping the edges of the desktop, jaw set. She brushed away the traitorous tear. She had been trained to be strong even when surrounded by an unfamiliar city and its people. She had work to do.\n\nShe rose, leaving the letters on the table with the bag of coins and Lemex\u2019s journal. She made her way down the stairs, avoiding the broken steps, to where the mercenaries were teaching Parlin how to play a game with wooden cards. The three men looked up as Vivenna approached. She settled herself carefully on the floor, sitting with her legs beneath her in an unassuming posture.\n\nShe met their eyes as she spoke. \u201cI know where some of Lemex\u2019s money came from,\u201d she said. \u201cIdris and Hallandren will soon go to war. Because of this threat, my father gave much greater resources to Lemex than I\u2019d realized. He sent enough money for Lemex to buy fifty Breaths, allowing him to enter the court and report on its proceedings. Obviously, my father didn\u2019t know that Lemex already had a sizable amount of Breath.\u201d\n\nThe three men were silent. Tonk Fah shot a glance at Denth, who sat back, resting against an overturned, broken chair.\n\n\u201cI believe that Lemex was still loyal to Idris,\u201d she said. \u201cHis personal writings make that relatively clear. He was not a traitor; he was simply greedy. He wanted as much Breath as possible because he had heard that it extended a person\u2019s life. Lemex and my father had planned to hinder the war preparations from inside Hallandren. Lemex promised he would find a way to sabotage the Lifeless armies, damage the city\u2019s supplies, and generally undermine their ability to wage war. For him to accomplish this, my father sent him a large sum of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout five thousand marks\u2019 worth?\u201d Denth asked, rubbing his chin.\n\n\u201cLess than that,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cBut a large chunk nonetheless. I believe that you are right about Lemex, Denth\u2014he has been stealing from the Crown for some time.\u201d\n\nShe fell silent. Parlin looked confused. That wasn\u2019t uncommon. The mercenaries, however, didn\u2019t look surprised.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if Lemex intended to do as my father asked,\u201d Vivenna said, keeping her voice even. \u201cThe way he hid the money, some of the things he wrote . . . well, maybe he was finally planning to turn traitor and run. We can\u2019t know what he would eventually have decided. We do, however, have a vague list of things he planned to accomplish. Those plans were convincing enough to persuade my father, and the urgency of his letters has convinced me. We are going to continue Lemex\u2019s work and undermine Hallandren\u2019s ability to wage war.\u201d\n\nThe room fell silent. \u201cAnd . . . your sister?\u201d Parlin finally asked.\n\n\u201cWe will get her out,\u201d Vivenna said firmly. \u201cHer rescue and safety is our first priority.\u201d \u201cThat is all easier discussed than accomplished, Princess,\u201d Denth said. \u201cI know.\u201d\nThe mercenaries shared a look. \u201cWell,\u201d Denth finally said, standing up. \u201cBetter get back to work, then.\u201d He nodded at Tonk Fah, who sighed and grumbled, standing.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Vivenna said, frowning. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI figured once you saw those papers that you\u2019d want to continue,\u201d Denth said, stretching. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve seen what he was up to, I can piece together why he had us do some of the things we were involved in. One of those was to contact and support some rebellious factions here in the city, including one that was stamped out just a few weeks back. Cult of disaffection centered on a guy named Vahr.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways wondered why Lemex gave him support,\u201d Tonk Fah said.\n\n\u201cThat faction\u2019s dead,\u201d Denth said, \u201calong with Vahr himself. But a lot of his followers are still around. Waiting for trouble to come their way. We can contact them. There are a few other leads I think we can look into, things Lemex didn\u2019t explain completely, but which I might be able to figure out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd . . . you can handle something like this?\u201d Vivenna asked. \u201cYou just said it wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d\n\nDenth shrugged. \u201cWon\u2019t be. But if you haven\u2019t realized it yet, this kind of thing is why Lemex hired us. A team of three high-priced, specialist mercenaries isn\u2019t exactly the type of thing you keep around to serve your tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless you want the tea rammed up someplace uncomfortable,\u201d Tonk Fah noted.\n\nThree mercenaries? Vivenna thought. That\u2019s right. There\u2019s another one. A woman.\u201cWhere\u2019s the other member of your team?\u201d\n\n\u201cJewels?\u201d Denth asked. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet her soon enough.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Tonk Fah said under his breath.\n\nDenth elbowed his friend. \u201cFor now, let us go back out and see how things stand on our projects. Gather what you want from this house. We\u2019ll move out tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cMove out?\u201d Vivenna said.\n\n\u201cUnless you want to sleep on a mattress Tonk Fah ripped into five pieces,\u201d Denth noted. \u201cHe has a thing about mattresses.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd chairs,\u201d Tonk Fah said cheerfully, \u201cand tables, and doors, and walls, actually. Oh, and people.\u201d\n\n\u201cEither way, Princess,\u201d Denth said, \u201cthis building was well known to people who worked with Lemex. As you\u2019ve discovered, he wasn\u2019t exactly the most honest fellow around. I doubt you want the baggage that comes with being associated with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBest to move to another house,\u201d Tonk Fah agreed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try not to break up the next one quite so badly,\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cNo promises though,\u201d Tonk Fah said with a wink.\n\nAnd then the two left.\nSiri stood before the door to her husband\u2019s bedchamber, shuffling nervously. As usual, Bluefingers stood beside her, and he was the only other one in the hallway. He scribbled on his pad, giving no indication of how he always knew when it was time for her to enter.\n\nFor once, she didn\u2019t mind the delay, nervous though she was. It gave her more time to think about what she was going to do. The day\u2019s events still buzzed about in her head: Treledees, telling her that she needed to provide an heir. Lightsong the Bold, talking in circles, then leaving her with what had seemed like a heartfelt farewell. Her king and husband, sitting on his tower above, bending light around him. The priests below, arguing about whether or not to invade her homeland.\n\nA lot of people wanted to push her in different directions, yet none of them were really willing to tell her how to do what they wanted\u2014and some didn\u2019t even bother to tell her whatthey wanted. The only thing they were accomplishing was annoying her. She was not a seductress. She had no idea how to make the God King desire her\u2014particularly since she was terrified of him doing just that.\n\nHigh Priest Treledees had given her a command. Therefore, she intended to show him how she responded to commands, particularly when they had threats attached to them. Tonight, she would go into the king\u2019s bedchamber, sit down on the floor, and refuse to strip. She\u2019d confront the God King. He didn\u2019t want her. Well, she was tired of being ogled every night.\n\nShe intended to explain all this to him in no uncertain terms. If he wanted to see her naked again, he\u2019d have to order servants to strip her. She doubted that he\u2019d do that. He\u2019d made no move toward her, and when he presided over the arena debates, he\u2019d actually done no more than sit and watch. She was getting a new impression of this God King. He was a man with so much power, he had grown lazy. He was a man who had everything, and so he bothered with nothing. He was a man who expected others to do everything for him. People like him annoyed her. She was reminded of a guard captain in Idris who had insisted on making his men work hard, while he spent his afternoons playing cards.\n\nIt was time the God King was defied. More than that, it was time that his priests learned that they couldn\u2019t bully her. She was tired of being used. To night, she would react. That was her decision. And it made her nervous as all Colors.\n\nShe glanced at Bluefingers. Eventually, she caught his eye. \u201cDo they really watch me each night?\u201d she asked, leaning in and whispering.\n\nHe paused, paling slightly. He glanced to either side, then shook his head.\n\nShe frowned. But Treledees knew that I hadn\u2019t been bedded by the God King.\n\nBluefingers raised a finger, pointing to his eyes, then shook his head. Then he pointed to his ears and nodded. He pointed to a doorway down the hall.\n\nThey listen, Siri thought.\n\nBluefingers leaned in closer. \u201cThey would never watch, Vessel,\u201d he whispered. \u201cRemember, the God King is their holiest of deities. Seeing him nude, watching him with his wife . . . no, they wouldn\u2019t dare. However, they aren\u2019t above listening.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cThey are very concerned about an heir.\u201d\nBluefingers glanced about nervously.\n\n\u201cAm I really in danger from them?\u201d she asked.\n\nHe met her eyes, then nodded sharply. \u201cMore danger than you know, Vessel.\u201d Then he backed away, gesturing at the doorway.\n\nYou have to help me! she mouthed at him.\n\nHe shook his head, holding up his hands. I cannot. Not now. With that, he pushed open the door, bowed, and scuttled away, glancing nervously over his shoulder.\n\nSiri glared at him. The time was swiftly approaching when she\u2019d need to corner him and find out what he really knew. Until then, she had other people to annoy. She turned and glanced into the dark room. Her nervousness returned.\n\nIs this wise? Being belligerent had never bothered her before. And yet . . . her life wasn\u2019t like it had been before. Bluefingers\u2019s fear had left her even more on edge.\n\nDefiance. It had always been her way to get attention. She hadn\u2019t been obstinate out of spite. She\u2019d simply been unable to measure up to Vivenna, so she\u2019d just done the opposite of what was expected of her. Her defiance had worked in the past. Or had it? Her father had been perpetually angry at her, and Vivenna had always treated her like a child. The city\u2019s people had loved her, but sufferingly.\n\nNo, Siri thought suddenly. No, I can\u2019t go back to that. The people in this palace\u2014this court\u2014they aren\u2019t the types you can defy just because you\u2019re annoyed. Spurn the palace priests, and they wouldn\u2019t grumble at her like her father had. They\u2019d show her what it really meant to be in their power.\n\nBut what to do then? She couldn\u2019t keep throwing off her clothing and kneeling on the floor, naked, could she?\n\nFeeling confused, and a little angry at herself, she stepped into the dark room and pulled the door closed. The God King waited in his corner, shadowed as always. Siri looked at him, staring at that too-calm face. She knew that she should disrobe and kneel, but she didn\u2019t.\n\nNot because she felt defiant. Not even because she felt angry or petulant. Because she was tired of wondering. Who was this man who could rule gods and bend light with the force of his BioChroma? Was he really just spoiled and indolent?\n\nHe stared back at her. As before, he didn\u2019t grow angry at her insolence. Watching him, Siri pulled at the strings on her dress, dropping the bulky garment to the floor. She reached for the shoulders of her shift, but hesitated.\n\nNo, she thought. This isn\u2019t right either.\n\nShe glanced down at the shift; the edges of the white garment fuzzed, the white bending into color. She looked up at the God King\u2019s impassive face.\n\nThen\u2014gritting her teeth against her nervousness\u2014Siri took a step forward.\nHe tensed. She could see it in the edges of his eyes and around his lips. She took another step forward, the white of her garment bending further into prismatic colors. The God King didn\u2019t do anything. He just watched as she drew closer and closer.\n\nShe stopped right in front of him. Then she turned from him and climbed up onto the bed, feeling the deep softness beneath her as she crawled to the middle of its mattress. She sat up on her knees, regarding the black marble wall with its obsidian sheen. The God King\u2019s priests waited just beyond, listening carefully to hear things that were really none of their business.\n\nThis, she thought, taking a deep breath, is going to be exceptionally embarrassing. But she\u2019d been forced to lie prostrate, naked, before the God King for over a week. Was now really the time to start feeling self-conscious?\n\nShe began to bounce up and down on the bed, making its springs creak. Then, cringing slightly, she started to moan.\n\nShe hoped it was convincing. She didn\u2019t really know what it was supposed to sound like. And how long did it usually continue? She tried to make her moans get louder and louder, her bouncing more furious, for what she assumed was a proper amount of time. Then she stopped sharply, let out a final moan, and fell back onto the bed.\n\nAll was still. She glanced up, eyeing the God King. Some of his emotional mask had softened, and he displayed a very human look of confusion. She almost laughed out loud at how perplexed he seemed. She just met his eyes and shook her head. Then\u2014her heart beating, her skin a bit sweaty\u2014she lay back on the bed to rest.\n\nTired from the day\u2019s events and intrigues, it wasn\u2019t long after that she found herself rolled up in the luxurious comforter and relaxing. The God King left her alone. In fact, he\u2019d grown tense at her approach, almost as if he were worried. Even frightened of her.\n\nThat couldn\u2019t be. He was the God and King of Hallandren, and she was just a silly girl, swimming in waters that were far over her head. No, he wasn\u2019t frightened. The concept was enough to again make her feel like laughing. She restrained herself, maintaining the illusion for the listening priests as she drifted off in the luxurious comfort of the bed.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, Lightsong did not get out of bed. His servants stood around the perimeter of his room like a flock of birds waiting for seed. As noon approached, they began to shuffle uncomfortably, shooting glances at one another.\n\nHe remained in bed, staring up at the ornate red canopy. Some servants approached tentatively, placing a tray of food atop a small table beside him. Lightsong did not reach for it.\n\nHe had dreamed of war again.\n\nFinally, a figure walked up to the bed. Large of girth and draped in his priestly robes, Llarimar looked down at his god, betraying none of the annoyance that Lightsong was sure that he felt. \u201cLeave us, please,\u201d Llarimar said to the servants.\nThey hesitated, uncertain. When was a god without his servants?\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Llarimar repeated, though somehow his tone indicated that it was not a request. Slowly, the servants filed from the room. Llarimar moved the tray of food, then sat down on the edge of the low table. He studied Lightsong, expression thoughtful.\n\nWhat did I ever do to earn a priest like him? Lightsong thought. He knew many of the high priests of other Returned, and most of them were various levels of insufferable. Some were quick to anger, others quick to point out fault, and still others were so fulsomely effusive toward their gods that it was downright maddening. Treledees, the God King\u2019s own high priest, was so stuck-up that he made even gods feel inferior.\n\nAnd then there was Llarimar. Patient, understanding. He deserved a better god.\n\n\u201cAll right, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick,\u201d Lightsong said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get sick, Your Grace.\u201d\n\nLightsong gave a few weak coughs, to which Llarimar just rolled his eyes. \u201cOh come on, Scoot,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cCan\u2019t you just play along a little?\u201d\n\u201cPlay along that you are sick?\u201d Llarimar asked, showing a hint of amusement. \u201cYour Grace, to do that would be to pretend that you\u2019re not a god. I do not believe that\u2019s a good pre cedent for your high priest to set.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d Lightsong whispered. \u201cI\u2019m no god.\u201d\n\nAgain, there was no sign of annoyance or anger from Llarimar. He just leaned down. \u201cPlease don\u2019t say such things, Your Grace. Even if you yourself do not believe, you should not say so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the sake of the many who do believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I should continue to deceive them?\u201d\n\nLlarimar shook his head. \u201cIt is no deception. It\u2019s not so uncommon for others to have more faith in someone than he has in himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t strike you as a little odd in my case?\u201d\n\nLlarimar smiled. \u201cNot knowing your temperament, it doesn\u2019t. Now, what brought this on?\u201d\n\nLightsong turned, looking up at the ceiling again. \u201cBlushweaver wants my Commands for the Lifeless.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll destroy that new queen of ours,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cBlushweaver worries that the Idrian royals are making a play for the Hallandren throne.\u201d\n\u201cDo you disagree?\u201d\n\nLightsong shook his head. \u201cNo. They probably are. But the thing is, I don\u2019t think the girl\u2014the queen\u2014 knows that she\u2019s part of anything. I\u2019m worried that Blushweaver will crush the child out of fear. I\u2019m worried that she\u2019ll be too aggressive and get us all into a war, when I don\u2019t know yet if that\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems that you already have a good handle on all this, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of it, Scoot,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cI feel myself getting sucked in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is your duty to be involved so that you can lead your kingdom. You can\u2019t avoid politics.\u201d \u201cI can if I don\u2019t get out of bed.\u201d\n\nLlarimar raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou don\u2019t honestly believe that, do you, Your Grace?\u201d\n\nLightsong sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to give me a lecture about how even my inaction has political effects, are you?\u201d\n\nLlarimar hesitated. \u201cPerhaps. Like it or not, you are a part of the workings of this kingdom\u2014and you produce effects even if you stay in bed. If you do nothing, then the problems are as much your fault as if you had instigated them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cNo, I think you\u2019re wrong. If I don\u2019t do anything, then at least I can\u2019t ruin things. Sure, I can let them go wrong, but that\u2019s not the same thing. It really isn\u2019t, no matter what people say.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if, by acting, you could make things better?\u201d\n\nLightsong shook his head. \u201cNot going to happen. You know me better than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cI know you better, perhaps, than you think I do. You\u2019ve always been one of the best men I have known.\u201d\n\nLightsong rolled his eyes, but then stopped, noting the expression on Llarimar\u2019s face.\n\nBest men I have known . . .\n\nLightsong sat up. \u201cYou knew me!\u201d he accused. \u201cThat\u2019s why you chose to be my priest. You did know me before! Before I died!\u201d\n\nLlarimar said nothing.\n\n\u201cWho was I?\u201d Lightsong asked. \u201cA good man, you claim. What was it about me that made me a good man?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can say nothing, Your Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already said something,\u201d Lightsong said, raising a finger. \u201cYou might as well go on. No turning back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said too much already.\u201d\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Lightsong said. \u201cJust a little bit. Was I from T\u2019Telir, then? How did I die?\u201d Who is she, the woman I see in my dreams?\n\nLlarimar said nothing further.\n\n\u201cI could command you to speak . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo you couldn\u2019t,\u201d Llarimar said, smiling as he stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s like the rain, Your Grace. You\n\ncan say you want to command the weather to change, but you don\u2019t believe it, deep down. It doesn\u2019t obey, and neither would I.\u201d\n\nConvenient bit of theology, that, Lightsong thought. Particularly when you want to hide things from your gods.\n\nLlarimar turned to go. \u201cYou have paintings waiting to be judged, Your Grace. I suggest that you let your servants bathe and dress you so that you can get through the day\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nLightsong sighed, stretching. How exactly did he just do that to me? he thought. Llarimar hadn\u2019t even really revealed anything, yet Lightsong had overcome his bout of melancholy. He eyed Llarimar as the priest reached the door and waved for the servants to return. Perhaps dealing with sullen deities was part of his job description.\n\nBut . . . he knew me before, Lightsong thought. And now he\u2019s my priest. How did that happen? \u201cScoot,\u201d Lightsong said, drawing the priest\u2019s attention. Llarimar turned, guarded, obviously expecting Lightsong to pry further into his past.\n\n\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Lightsong asked. \u201cAbout Blushweaver and the queen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot tell you, Your Grace,\u201d Llarimar said. \u201cYou see, it is from what you do that we learn. If I guide you, then we gain nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept perhaps the life of a young girl who is being used as a pawn.\u201d\n\nLlarimar paused. \u201cDo your best, Your Grace,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is all I can suggest.\u201d\n\nGreat, Lightsong thought as he stood. He didn\u2019t know what his \u201cbest\u201d was.\n\nThe truth was, he\u2019d never bothered to find out.\n\n\u201cThis is nice,\u201d Denth said, looking over the house. \u201cStrong wood paneling. Will break very cleanly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tonk Fah added, peeking into a closet. \u201cAnd it has plenty of storage. Bet we could fit a good half-dozen bodies in here alone.\u201d\n\nVivenna shot the two mercenaries a look, causing them to chuckle to themselves. The house wasn\u2019t as nice as Lemex\u2019s had been; she didn\u2019t want to be ostentatious. It was one of many that were built in a row along a well-maintained street. Deeper than it was wide, the building was bordered on either side with large palm trees, obscuring the view should someone try to spy from the neighboring buildings.\n\nShe was pleased. Part of her balked at living in a home that was\u2014despite being modest by Hallandren standards\u2014nearly as large as the king\u2019s palace back in Idris. However, she and Parlin had looked at and\nrejected cheaper sections of town. She didn\u2019t want to live in a place where she was afraid to go out at night, particularly since she worried that her Breath might make her a target.\n\nShe trailed down the stairs, the mercenaries following. The house had three stories\u2014a small upper story with sleeping chambers, the main floor with a kitchen and sitting room, and a cellar for storage. The building was sparsely furnished, and Parlin had gone to the market to shop for more. She hadn\u2019t wanted to spend the money, but Denth had pointed out that they must at leasttry to keep up appearances, lest they end up drawing even more attention.\n\n\u201cOld Lemex\u2019s house will be taken care of soon,\u201d Denth said. \u201cWe left some hints in the underground, mentioning that the old man was dead. Whatever we didn\u2019t ransack, a gang of burglars will take care of tonight. By tomorrow, the city guard will be there, and they\u2019ll assume that the place was burgled. The nurse has been paid off, and she never knew who Lemex really was anyway. When nobody comes to pay for the funeral ser vices, the authorities will take the house in forfeit and have the body burned with other debtors.\u201d\n\nVivenna stopped at the bottom of the stairs, paling. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound very respectful.\u201d\n\nDenth shrugged. \u201cWhat do you want to do? Go claim him at the charnel house yourself? Give him an Idrian ceremony?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood way to get people asking questions, that,\u201d Tonk Fah said.\n\n\u201cBetter to just let others deal with it,\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Vivenna said, turning away from the stairs and walking into the sitting room. \u201cIt just bothers me, letting his body be cared for by . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBy what?\u201d Denth said, amused. \u201cPagans?\u201d\n\nVivenna didn\u2019t look at him.\n\n\u201cThe old man didn\u2019t seem to care much about heathen ways,\u201d Tonk Fah noted. \u201cNot with the number of Breaths he held. Of course, didn\u2019t your daddy give him the money to buy them?\u201d\n\nVivenna closed her eyes.\n\nYou hold those same Breaths, she told herself. You\u2019re not innocent in all of this.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t been given a choice. She could only hope and assume that her father had felt he was in a similar position\u2014no choice but to do what seemed wrong.\n\nLacking furniture, Vivenna arranged her dress and knelt on the wooden floor, hands in her lap. Denth and Tonk Fah sat back against the wall, looking just as comfortable sitting on a hardwood floor as they were when lounging in plush chairs. \u201cAll right, Princess,\u201d Denth said, unfolding a paper from his pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some plans for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease continue, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst,\u201d Denth said, \u201cwe can get you a meeting with some of Vahr\u2019s allies.\u201d\n\u201cWho exactly was this man?\u201d Vivenna said, frowning. She didn\u2019t like the idea of working with revolutionaries.\n\n\u201cVahr was a worker in the dye fields,\u201d Denth said. \u201cThings can get bad out in those fields\u2014long hours, little more than food for pay. About five years back, Vahr got the bright idea that if he could convince enough of the other workers to give him their Breath, he might be able to use the power to start a revolt against the overseers. Became enough of a hero to the people in the outer flower plantations that he actually drew the attention of the Court of Gods.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever truly had a chance of starting a real rebellion,\u201d Tonk Fah said.\n\n\u201cSo what good are his men to us?\u201d Vivenna asked. \u201cIf they never had a chance of succeeding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Denth said, \u201cyou didn\u2019t say anything about a rebellion or anything like that. You just want to make it tough for the Hallandren when they go to war.\u201d\n\n\u201cRevolts in the fields would sure be a pain during war,\u201d Tonk Fah added.\n\nVivenna nodded. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s meet with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust so you know, Princess,\u201d Denth said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t particularly . . . sophisticated kinds of folks.\u201d \u201cI am not offended by poverty or people of small means. Austre regards all people equally.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d Denth said, rubbing his chin. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re peasants, it\u2019s that . . . well, when Vahr\u2019s little insurrection went bad, these are the people who were smart enough to get out quickly. That means they weren\u2019t all that committed to him in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d Tonk Fah said, \u201cthey were really just a bunch of thugs and crime lords who thought Vahr might be the source of some easy influence or money.\u201d\n\nGreat, Vivenna thought. \u201cAnd do we want to associate with people like that?\u201d Denth shrugged. \u201cWe have to start somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other things on the list are a bit more fun,\u201d Tonk Fah said.\n\n\u201cAnd they are?\u201d Vivenna asked.\n\n\u201cRaid the Lifeless storage warehouse, for one,\u201d Denth said, smiling. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to kill the things\u2014not without drawing the rest of them down on us. But we might be able to muck up the way the creatures work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds dangerous,\u201d Vivenna said.\n\nDenth glanced at Tonk Fah, who opened his eyes. They shared a smile.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Vivenna asked.\n\n\u201cHazard pay,\u201d Tonk Fah said. \u201cWe may not steal your money, but we have nothing against overcharging you for extremely dangerous stunts!\u201d\n\nVivenna rolled her eyes.\n\u201cBeyond that,\u201d Denth added, \u201cfrom what I can tell, Lemex wanted to undermine the city\u2019s food supply. It\u2019s a good idea, I suppose. Lifeless don\u2019t need to eat, but the humans who form the support structure of the army do. Disrupt supply, and perhaps people here will begin to worry if they can afford a long term war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds more reasonable,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cWhat did you come up with?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe raid merchant caravans,\u201d Denth said. \u201cBurn things up, cost them a bunch. We make it look like bandits or maybe even remnants of Vahr\u2019s supporters. That ought to confuse people in T\u2019Telir and maybe make it more difficult for the priests to go to war.\u201d\n\n\u201cPriests run a lot of the trade in the city,\u201d Tonk Fah added. \u201cThey have all the money so they tend to own the supplies. Burn away the stuff they intended to use for the war, and they\u2019ll be more hesitant to attack. It\u2019ll buy your people more time.\u201d\n\nVivenna swallowed. \u201cYour plans are a bit more . . . violent than I had anticipated.\u201d The mercenaries shared a look.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d Denth said. \u201cThis is where we get our bad reputation. People hire us to do difficult things\u2014 like undermine a country\u2019s ability to wage war\u2014then complain that we\u2019re too violent.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery unfair,\u201d Tonk Fah agreed.\n\n\u201cPerhaps she\u2019d rather we buy puppies for all of her enemies, then send them with nice apologetic notes, asking them to stop being so mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d Tonk Fah said, \u201cwhen they don\u2019t stop, we could kill the puppies!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cI understand that we\u2019ll have to use a firm hand, but . . . really. I don\u2019t want the Hallandren to starve because of what we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d Denth said, sounding more serious. \u201cThese people want to attack your homeland. They see your family as the greatest existing threat to their power\u2014and they\u2019re going to make certain that nobody of the royal blood lives to challenge them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey get a child by your sister to be the next God King,\u201d Tonk Fah said, \u201cthen they kill every other person of royal blood. They never have to worry about you again.\u201d\n\nDenth nodded. \u201cYour father and Lemex were right. The Hallandren have everything to lose by not attacking you. And, from what I can see, your people are going to need every bit of help you can give them. That means doing everything we can\u2014scaring the priests, breaking their supply reserves, weakening their armies\u2014to help out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop the war,\u201d Tonk Fah added. \u201cWe can just make the fight a little more fair.\u201d Vivenna took a deep breath, then nodded. \u201cAll right, then, we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\nAt that moment, the door to the building flew open, slamming against the other side of the wall. Vivenna looked up. A figure stood in the doorway\u2014a tall, bulky man with unusually large muscles and flat features. It took her a moment to register the other oddity about him.\nHis skin was grey. His eyes too. There was no color to him at all, and her Heightenings told her that he didn\u2019t have a single Breath. A Lifeless soldier.\n\nVivenna scrambled to her feet, barely keeping in a cry of distress. She backed away from the large soldier. It just stood there, immobile, not even breathing. Its eyes tracked her\u2014they didn\u2019t just stare ahead like those of a dead man.\n\nFor some reason, she found that the most unnerving. \u201cDenth!\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cWhat are you doing? Attack!\u201d\n\nThe mercenaries remained where they were, lounging on the floor. Tonk Fah barely cracked an eye open. \u201cAh well,\u201d Denth said. \u201cLooks like we\u2019ve been discovered by the city watch.\u201d\n\n\u201cPity,\u201d Tonk Fah said. \u201cThis was looking like it would be a fun job.\u201d \u201cNothing but execution for us now,\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cAttack!\u201d Vivenna cried. \u201cYou\u2019re my bodyguards, you\u2019re . . .\u201d She trailed off, noticing as the two men began to chuckle.\n\nOh, Colors, not again, she thought. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said. \u201cSome kind of joke? Did you paint that man grey? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cMove it, you rock on legs,\u201d a voice said from behind the Lifeless. The creature walked into the room, carrying a couple of canvas bags over its shoulders. As it entered, it revealed a shorter woman standing behind. Thick through the thighs and through the bust, she had light brown hair that came down to her shoulders. She stood with hands on hips, looking upset.\n\n\u201cDenth,\u201d she snapped, \u201che\u2019s here. In the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Denth said, lounging back. \u201cI owe that man a sword through the gut.\u201d The woman snorted. \u201cHe killed Arsteel. What makes you think you can beat him?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always been the better swordsman,\u201d Denth said calmly.\n\u201cArsteel was good too. Now he\u2019s dead. Who\u2019s the woman?\u201d \u201cNew employer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHope she lives longer than the last one,\u201d the woman grumbled. \u201cClod, put those down and go get the other bag.\u201d\n\nThe Lifeless responded, setting down its bags and then walking back out. Vivenna watched, by now having figured out that the short woman must be Jewels, the third member of Denth\u2019s team. What was she doing with a Lifeless? And how had she found the new house? Denth must have sent her a message.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Jewels said, glancing at Vivenna. \u201cSome Awakener come by and steal your colors?\u201d\n\nVivenna paused. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cShe means,\u201d Denth said, \u201cwhy do you look so surprised?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat, and her hair is white,\u201d Jewels said, walking over to the canvas bags.\n\nVivenna flushed, realizing that her shock had gotten the better of her. She returned her hair to its proper dark color. The Lifeless was returning, carrying another bag.\n\n\u201cWhere did that creature come from?\u201d Vivenna asked.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jewels asked. \u201cClod? Made him from a dead body, obviously. I didn\u2019t do it myself\u2014I just paid money for someone else to.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo much money,\u201d Tonk Fah added.\n\nThe creature clomped back into the room. It wasn\u2019t unnaturally tall\u2014not like a Returned. It could have been a normal, if well-muscled, man. Only the skin coloring, mixed with the emotionless face, was different.\n\n\u201cShe bought him?\u201d Vivenna asked. \u201cWhen? Just now?\u201d \u201cNah,\u201d Tonk Fah said, \u201cwe\u2019ve had Clod for months.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s useful to have a Lifeless around,\u201d Denth said.\n\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me about this?\u201d Vivenna asked, trying to keep the hysteria out of her voice. First she\u2019d had to deal with the city and all of its colors and people. Then she was given a dose of unwanted Breath. Now she was confronted by the most unholy of abominations.\n\n\u201cThe topic didn\u2019t come up,\u201d Denth said, shrugging. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty common in T\u2019Telir.\u201d \u201cWe were just talking about defeating these things,\u201d Vivenna said. \u201cNot embracing them!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe talked about defeating some of them,\u201d Denth said. \u201cPrincess, Lifeless are like swords. They\u2019re tools. We can\u2019t destroy all of them in the city, nor would we want to. Just the ones being used by your enemies.\u201d\n\nVivenna slid down, sitting on the wooden floor. The Lifeless set down its final bag, then Jewels pointed toward the corner. It walked over and stood there, patiently waiting for further orders.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Jewels said to the other two, untying the final large bag. \u201cYou wanted these.\u201d She turned it on its side, exposing glittering metal shining within.\n\nDenth smiled, rising. He kicked Tonk Fah back awake\u2014the large man had an uncanny ability to fall asleep at a moment\u2019s notice\u2014and walked over to the bag. He pulled out several swords, shiny and new-looking with long, thin blades. Denth made a few practice swings while Tonk Fah wandered over, pulling out wicked-looking daggers, some shorter swords, and then some leather jerkins.\n"], "title": ["Warbreaker"], "author": ["Brandon Sanderson"]}
