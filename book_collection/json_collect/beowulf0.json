{"genre": ["Fantasy"], "text": ["PREFACE.\n\n\nThe present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately, in modern\nmeasures, the venerable epic, Beowulf. _Approximately_, I repeat; for a\nvery close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be\nprose to a modern ear.\n\nThe Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally\na deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient\nreason. The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while,\nhowever, he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted\nfrom the criticisms of other students of the poem.\n\nThis work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike\nthe translator begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he\nhopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. The student of\nEnglish literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the\nmost ancient epic of our race. This is a bold and venturesome undertaking;\nand yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow\neven a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of\nHrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the\nhearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.\n\nIn order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been\nused, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of\nthe original, permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading.\n\nPerhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his own theory as to how Beowulf\nshould be translated. Some have given us prose versions of what we believe\nto be a great poem. Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold\nto say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is\njustly called our first _epic_? Of those translators who have used verse,\nseveral have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view. Is it\nproper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and\nHrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along? Or,\nagain, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be\ninterpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse? Do we hear\nwhat has been beautifully called \"the clanging tread of a warrior in\nmail\"?\n\n[viii]\n\nOf all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone\ngives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great\nTeutonic epic.\n\nThe measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a\nreproduction of the original as modern English affords. The cadences\nclosely resemble those used by Browning in some of his most striking\npoems. The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as\nmuch thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular\ncadence. Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought\nthat modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line. End-rhyme has\nbeen used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some\nwarrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. (For end-rhyme, see 1_53, 1_54; for\ninternal rhyme, 2_21, 6_40.)\n\nWhat Gummere[1] calls the \"rime-giver\" has been studiously kept; _viz._,\nthe first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the\nalliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only\nsporadically. Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the\noriginal. (See 7_61, 8_5.)\n\nNo two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally\nafter a c\u00e6sural pause. (See 2_19 and 12_1.) Or, scientifically speaking,\nSievers's C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of\ntranslation. Several of his types, however, constantly occur; _e.g._ A and\na variant (/ x | / x) (/ x x | / x); B and a variant (x / | x / ) (x x / |\nx / ); a variant of D (/ x | / x x); E (/ x x | / ). Anacrusis gives\nfurther variety to the types used in the translation.\n\nThe parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. (_E.g._,\n1_16 and 1_17: \"Lord\" and \"Wielder of Glory\"; 1_30, 1_31, 1_32; 2_12 and\n2_13; 2_27 and 2_28; 3_5 and 3_6.) Occasionally, some loss has been\nsustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.\n\nThe effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the\ntranslation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have\nbeen avoided. Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are\nnone, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.\n\n[ix]\n\nWith these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of\nthe story of the poem.\n\n\n_THE STORY._\n\n_Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or\npalace, in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents.\nThe joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the\nmonster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He cannot brook the sounds of\njoyance that reach him down in his fen-dwelling near the hall. Oft and\nanon he goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. Thane after\nthane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong\nenough and bold enough to cope with the monster. For twelve years he\npersecutes Hrothgar and his vassals._\n\n_Over sea, a day's voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac,\nking of the Geats, hears of Grendel's doings and of Hrothgar's misery. He\nresolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With\nfourteen chosen companions, he sets sail for Dane-land. Reaching that\ncountry, he soon persuades Hrothgar of his ability to help him. The hours\nthat elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation. When\nHrothgar's bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling\nhim that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his\npalace. All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his arms._\n\n_Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God's anger. He seizes\nand kills one of the sleeping warriors. Then he advances towards Beowulf.\nA fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used,\nboth combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. Beowulf tears\nGrendel's shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his den,\nhowling and yelling with agony and fury. The wound is fatal._\n\n_The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall\nHeorot, to hear the news. Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and\nhis retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._\n\n_Grendel's mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. She\nis furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart\n[x] from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of Hrothgar's\nfavorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. Beowulf is\ncalled. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and\ngoes down to look for the female monster. After traveling through the\nwaters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. She drags him to her\nden. There he sees Grendel lying dead. After a desperate and almost fatal\nstruggle with the woman, he slays her, and swims upward in triumph, taking\nwith him Grendel's head._\n\n_Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Hrothgar\nliterally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among\nthe vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord._\n\n_Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure._\n\n_When the hero arrives in his own land, Higelac treats him as a\ndistinguished guest. He is the hero of the hour._\n\n_Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people, the Geats. After he\nhas been ruling for fifty years, his own neighborhood is wofully harried\nby a fire-spewing dragon. Beowulf determines to kill him. In the ensuing\nstruggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is\ninexpressible. They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor\nthe memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his body is\nburnt. Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that\nsailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national\nhero of Geatland._\n\n_The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery, his gentleness,\nhis goodness of heart, and his generosity._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the\nstory of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that\nof the Iliad. Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history\nof the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our\nforefathers of pre-Alfredian eras, in their love of war, of sea, and of\nadventure.\n\nMy special thanks are due to Professors Francis A. March and James A.\nHarrison, for advice, sympathy, and assistance.\n\n                                                        J.L.

Clomb to the prow then\n          Well-equipped warriors: the wave-currents twisted\n          The sea on the sand; soldiers then carried\n       25 On the breast of the vessel bright-shining jewels,\n          Handsome war-armor; heroes outshoved then,\n          Warmen the wood-ship, on its wished-for adventure.\n\n[9]\n\n{The vessel sails like a bird}\n\n          The foamy-necked floater fanned by the breeze,\n          Likest a bird, glided the waters,\n\n{In twenty four hours they reach the shores of Hrothgar's dominions}\n\n       30 Till twenty and four hours thereafter\n          The twist-stemmed vessel had traveled such distance\n          That the sailing-men saw the sloping embankments,\n          The sea cliffs gleaming, precipitous mountains,\n          Nesses enormous: they were nearing the limits\n       35 At the end of the ocean.[2] Up thence quickly\n          The men of the Weders clomb to the mainland,\n          Fastened their vessel (battle weeds rattled,\n          War burnies clattered), the Wielder they thanked\n          That the ways o'er the waters had waxen so gentle.\n\n{They are hailed by the Danish coast guard}\n\n       40 Then well from the cliff edge the guard of the Scyldings\n          Who the sea-cliffs should see to, saw o'er the gangway\n          Brave ones bearing beauteous targets,\n          Armor all ready, anxiously thought he,\n          Musing and wondering what men were approaching.\n       45 High on his horse then Hrothgar's retainer\n          Turned him to coastward, mightily brandished\n          His lance in his hands, questioned with boldness.\n\n{His challenge}\n\n          \"Who are ye men here, mail-covered warriors\n          Clad in your corslets, come thus a-driving\n       50 A high riding ship o'er the shoals of the waters,\n          [3]And hither 'neath helmets have hied o'er the ocean?\n[10]      I have been strand-guard, standing as warden,\n          Lest enemies ever anywise ravage\n          Danish dominions with army of war-ships.\n       55 More boldly never have warriors ventured\n          Hither to come; of kinsmen's approval,\n          Word-leave of warriors, I ween that ye surely\n\n{He is struck by Beowulf's appearance.}\n\n          Nothing have known.

Ere ye pass on your journey\n          As treacherous spies to the land of the Scyldings\n       65 And farther fare, I fully must know now\n          What race ye belong to. Ye far-away dwellers,\n          Sea-faring sailors, my simple opinion\n          Hear ye and hearken: haste is most fitting\n          Plainly to tell me what place ye are come from.\"\n\n    [1] 'From h\u00e1m' (194) is much disputed. One rendering is: _Beowulf,\n    being away from home, heard of Hrothgar's troubles, etc_. Another,\n    that adopted by S. and endorsed in the H.-So. notes, is: _B. heard\n    from his neighborhood (neighbors),_ i.e. _in his home, etc_. A third\n    is: _B., being at home, heard this as occurring away from home_. The\n    H.-So. glossary and notes conflict.\n\n    [2] 'Eoletes' (224) is marked with a (?) by H.-So.; our rendering\n    simply follows his conjecture.--Other conjectures as to 'eolet' are:\n    (1) _voyage_, (2) _toil_, _labor_, (3) _hasty journey_.\n\n    [3] The lacuna of the MS at this point has been supplied by various\n    conjectures. The reading adopted by H.-So. has been rendered in the\n    above translation. W., like H.-So., makes 'ic' the beginning of a new\n    sentence, but, for 'helmas b\u00e6ron,' he reads 'hringed stefnan.' This\n    has the advantage of giving a parallel to 'brontne ceol' instead of a\n    kenning for 'go.'--B puts the (?) after 'holmas', and begins a new\n    sentence at the middle of the line. Translate: _What warriors are ye,\n    clad in armor, who have thus come bringing the foaming vessel over the\n    water way, hither over the seas? For some time on the wall I have been\n    coast guard, etc_. S. endorses most of what B. says, but leaves out\n    'on the wall' in the last sentence. If W.'s 'hringed stefnan' be\n    accepted, change line 51 above to, _A ring-stemmed vessel hither\n    o'ersea_.\n\n    [4] 'Seld-guma' (249) is variously rendered: (1) _housecarle_; (2)\n    _home-stayer_; (3) _common man_. Dr. H. Wood suggests _a man-at-arms\n    in another's house_.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nTHE GEATS REACH HEOROT.\n\n\n{Beowulf courteously replies.}\n\n          The chief of the strangers rendered him answer,\n          War-troopers' leader, and word-treasure opened:\n\n{We are Geats.}\n\n          \"We are sprung from the lineage of the people of Geatland,\n          And Higelac's hearth-friends.
