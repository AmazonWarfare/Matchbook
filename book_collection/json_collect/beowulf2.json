Neither emendation would make any\n    essential change in the translation.\n\n    [2] The separation of adjective and noun by a phrase (cf. v. 1118)\n    being very unusual, some scholars have put 'earme on eaxle' with the\n    foregoing lines, inserting a semicolon after 'eaxle.' In this case 'on\n    eaxe' (_i.e._, on the ashes, cinders) is sometimes read, and this\n    affords a parallel to 'on b\u00e6l.'

Moreover, what has the idea of single combat to do with B.\n    1247 ff.?

'Twas seen very clearly,\n\n{Grendel's mother is known to be thirsting for revenge.}\n\n          Known unto earth-folk, that still an avenger\n          Outlived the loathed one, long since the sorrow\n          Caused by the struggle; the mother of Grendel,\n          Devil-shaped woman, her woe ever minded,\n       10 Who was held to inhabit the horrible waters,\n\n{[Grendel's progenitor, Cain, is again referred to.]}\n\n          The cold-flowing currents, after Cain had become a\n          Slayer-with-edges to his one only brother,\n          The son of his sire; he set out then banished,\n          Marked as a murderer, man-joys avoiding,\n       15 Lived in the desert. Thence demons unnumbered\n\n{The poet again magnifies Beowulf's valor.}\n\n          Fate-sent awoke; one of them Grendel,\n          Sword-curs\u00e8d, hateful, who at Heorot met with\n          A man that was watching, waiting the struggle,\n          Where a horrid one held him with hand-grapple sturdy;\n       20 Nathless he minded the might of his body,\n          The glorious gift God had allowed him,\n          And folk-ruling Father's favor relied on,\n          His help and His comfort: so he conquered the foeman,\n          The hell-spirit humbled: he unhappy departed then,\n       25 Reaved of his joyance, journeying to death-haunts,\n          Foeman of man. His mother moreover\n\n{Grendel's mother comes to avenge her son.}\n\n          Eager and gloomy was anxious to go on\n          Her mournful mission, mindful of vengeance\n          For the death of her son. She came then to Heorot\n[45]   30 Where the Armor-Dane earlmen all through the building\n          Were lying in slumber. Soon there became then\n          Return[2] to the nobles, when the mother of Grendel\n          Entered the folk-hall; the fear was less grievous\n          By even so much as the vigor of maidens,\n       35 War-strength of women, by warrior is reckoned,\n          When well-carved weapon, worked with the hammer,\n          Blade very bloody, brave with its edges,\n          Strikes down the boar-sign that stands on the helmet.\n          Then the hard-edg\u00e8d weapon was heaved in the building,[3]\n       40 The brand o'er the benches, broad-lindens many\n          Hand-fast were lifted; for helmet he recked not,\n          For armor-net broad, whom terror laid hold of.\n          She went then hastily, outward would get her\n          Her life for to save, when some one did spy her;\n\n{She seizes a favorite liegemen of Hrothgar's.}\n\n       45 Soon she had grappled one of the athelings\n          Fast and firmly, when fenward she hied her;\n          That one to Hrothgar was liefest of heroes\n          In rank of retainer where waters encircle,\n          A mighty shield-warrior, whom she murdered at slumber,\n       50 A broadly-famed battle-knight. Beowulf was absent,\n\n{Beowulf was asleep in another part of the palace.}\n\n          But another apartment was erstwhile devoted\n          To the glory-decked Geatman when gold was distributed.\n          There was hubbub in Heorot. The hand that was famous\n          She grasped in its gore;[4] grief was renewed then\n[46]   55 In homes and houses: 'twas no happy arrangement\n          In both of the quarters to barter and purchase\n          With lives of their friends. Then the well-ag\u00e8d ruler,\n          The gray-headed war-thane, was woful in spirit,\n          When his long-trusted liegeman lifeless he knew of,\n\n{Beowulf is sent for.}\n\n       60 His dearest one gone.

The war-worthy hero\n          With a troop of retainers trod then the pavement\n          (The hall-building groaned), till he greeted the wise one,\n\n{Beowulf inquires how Hrothgar had enjoyed his night's rest.}\n\n          The earl of the Ingwins;[5] asked if the night had\n       70 Fully refreshed him, as fain he would have it.\n\n    [1] Several eminent authorities either read or emend the MS. so as to\n    make this verse read, _While Grendel was wasting the gold-bedecked\n    palace_. So 20_15 below: _ravaged the desert_.\n\n    [2] For 's\u00f3na' (1281), t.B. suggests 's\u00e1ra,' limiting 'edhwyrft.' Read\n    then: _Return of sorrows to the nobles, etc_. This emendation supplies\n    the syntactical gap after 'edhwyrft.'\n\n    [3] Some authorities follow Grein's lexicon in treating 'heard ecg' as\n    an adj. limiting 'sweord': H.-So. renders it as a subst. (So v. 1491.)\n    The sense of the translation would be the same.\n\n    [4] B. suggests 'under hr\u00f3f genam' (v. 1303). This emendation, as well\n    as an emendation with (?) to v. 739, he offers, because 'under'\n    baffles him in both passages. All we need is to take 'under' in its\n    secondary meaning of 'in,' which, though not given by Grein, occurs in\n    the literature. Cf. Chron. 876 (March's A.-S. Gram. \u00a7 355) and Oro.\n    Amaz. I. 10, where 'under' = _in the midst of_. Cf. modern Eng. 'in\n    such circumstances,' which interchanges in good usage with 'under such\n    circumstances.'\n\n    [5] For 'n\u00e9od-la\u00f0u' (1321) C. suggests 'n\u00e9ad-l\u00e1\u00f0um,' and translates:\n    _asked whether the night had been pleasant to him after\n    crushing-hostility_.\n\n\n\n\nXXI.\n\nHROTHGAR'S ACCOUNT OF THE MONSTERS.\n\n\n{Hrothgar laments the death of \u00c6schere, his shoulder-companion.}\n\n          Hrothgar rejoined, helm of the Scyldings:\n          \"Ask not of joyance!
