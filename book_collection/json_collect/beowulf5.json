All the war-troop arose then,\n          'Neath the Eagle's Cape sadly betook them,\n          Weeping and woful, the wonder to look at.\n          They saw on the sand then soulless a-lying,\n       90 His slaughter-bed holding, him who rings had given them\n          In days that were done; then the death-bringing moment\n          Was come to the good one, that the king very warlike,\n          Wielder of Weders, with wonder-death perished.\n          First they beheld there a creature more wondrous,\n\n{They also see the dragon.}\n\n       95 The worm on the field, in front of them lying,\n          The foeman before them: the fire-spewing dragon,\n          Ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors,\n          Was scorched in the fire; as he lay there he measured\n          Fifty of feet; came forth in the night-time[5]\n      100 To rejoice in the air, thereafter departing\n          To visit his den; he in death was then fastened,\n          He would joy in no other earth-hollowed caverns.\n          There stood round about him beakers and vessels,\n          Dishes were lying and dear-valued weapons,\n      105 With iron-rust eaten, as in earth's mighty bosom\n          A thousand of winters there they had rested:\n\n{The hoard was under a magic spell.}\n\n          That mighty bequest then with magic was guarded,\n          Gold of the ancients, that earlman not any\n          The ring-hall could touch, save Ruling-God only,\n[103] 110 Sooth-king of Vict'ries gave whom He wished to\n\n{God alone could give access to it.}\n\n          [6](He is earth-folk's protector) to open the treasure,\n          E'en to such among mortals as seemed to Him proper.\n\n    [1] For 'g\u00f3da,' which seems a surprising epithet for a Geat to apply\n    to the \"terrible\" Ongentheow, B. suggests 'gomela.' The passage would\n    then stand: '_The old one went then,' etc._\n\n    [2] For 'segn Higel\u00e1ce,' K., Th., and B. propose 'segn Higel\u00e1ces,'\n    meaning: _Higelac's banner followed the Swedes (in pursuit)._--S.\n    suggests 's\u00e6cc Higel\u00e1ces,' and renders: _Higelac's pursuit._--The\n    H.-So. reading, as translated in our text, means that the banner of\n    the enemy was captured and brought to Higelac as a trophy.\n\n    [3] The rendering given in this translation represents the king as\n    being generous beyond the possibility of reproach; but some\n    authorities construe 'him' (2996) as plu., and understand the passage\n    to mean that no one reproached the two brothers with having received\n    more reward than they were entitled to.\n\n    [4] The name 'Scyldingas' here (3006) has caused much discussion, and\n    given rise to several theories, the most important of which are as\n    follows: (1) After the downfall of Hrothgar's family, Beowulf was king\n    of the Danes, or Scyldings. (2) For 'Scyldingas' read\n    'Scylfingas'--that is, after killing Eadgils, the Scylfing prince,\n    Beowulf conquered his land, and held it in subjection. (3) M.\n    considers 3006 a thoughtless repetition of 2053. (Cf. H.-So.)\n\n    [5] B. takes 'nihtes' and 'hw\u00edlum' (3045) as separate adverbial cases,\n    and renders: _Joy in the air had he of yore by night, etc_. He thinks\n    that the idea of vanished time ought to be expressed.\n\n    [6] The parenthesis is by some emended so as to read: (1) (_He_ (i.e.\n    _God_) _is the hope of men_); (2) (_he is the hope of heroes_). Gr.'s\n    reading has no parenthesis, but says: ... _could touch, unless God\n    himself, true king of victories, gave to whom he would to open the\n    treasure, the secret place of enchanters, etc_. The last is rejected\n    on many grounds.\n\n\n\n\nXLII.\n\nWIGLAF'S SAD STORY.--THE HOARD CARRIED OFF.\n\n\n          Then 'twas seen that the journey prospered him little\n          Who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden[1]\n          Down 'neath the wall. The warden erst slaughtered\n          Some few of the folk-troop: the feud then thereafter\n        5 Was hotly aveng\u00e8d. 'Tis a wonder where,[2]\n          When the strength-famous trooper has attained to the end of\n          Life-days allotted, then no longer the man may\n          Remain with his kinsmen where mead-cups are flowing.\n          So to Beowulf happened when the ward of the barrow,\n       10 Assaults, he sought for: himself had no knowledge\n          How his leaving this life was likely to happen.\n          So to doomsday, famous folk-leaders down did\n          Call it with curses--who 'complished it there--\n[104]     That that man should be ever of ill-deeds convicted,\n       15 Confined in foul-places, fastened in hell-bonds,\n          Punished with plagues, who this place should e'er ravage.[3]\n          He cared not for gold: rather the Wielder's\n          Favor preferred he first to get sight of.[4]\n\n{Wiglaf addresses his comrades.}\n\n          Wiglaf discoursed then, Wihstan his son:\n       20 \"Oft many an earlman on one man's account must\n          Sorrow endure, as to us it hath happened.\n          The liegelord belov\u00e8d we could little prevail on,\n          Kingdom's keeper, counsel to follow,\n          Not to go to the guardian of the gold-hoard, but let him\n       25 Lie where he long was, live in his dwelling\n          Till the end of the world. Met we a destiny\n          Hard to endure: the hoard has been looked at,\n          Been gained very grimly; too grievous the fate that[5]\n          The prince of the people pricked to come thither.\n       30 _I_ was therein and all of it looked at,\n          The building's equipments, since access was given me,\n          Not kindly at all entrance permitted\n\n{He tells them of Beowulf's last moments.}\n\n          Within under earth-wall.

No lot then decided\n          Who that hoard should havoc, when hero-earls saw it\n          Lying in the cavern uncared-for entirely,\n          Rusting to ruin: they rued then but little\n       70 That they hastily hence hauled out the treasure,\n\n{They push the dragon over the wall.}\n\n          The dear-valued jewels; the dragon eke pushed they,\n          The worm o'er the wall, let the wave-currents take him,\n[106]     The waters enwind the ward of the treasures.\n\n{The hoard is laid on a wain.}\n\n          There wounden gold on a wain was uploaded,\n       75 A mass unmeasured, the men-leader off then,\n          The hero hoary, to Whale's-Ness was carried.\n\n    [1] For 'geh\u00fddde,' B. suggests 'geh\u00fd\u00f0de': the passage would stand as\n    above except the change of 'hidden' (v. 2) to 'plundered.' The\n    reference, however, would be to the thief, not to the dragon.\n\n    [2] The passage 'Wundur ... b\u00faan' (3063-3066), M. took to be a\n    question asking whether it was strange that a man should die when his\n    appointed time had come.--B. sees a corruption, and makes emendations\n    introducing the idea that a brave man should not die from sickness or\n    from old age, but should find death in the performance of some deed of\n    daring.--S. sees an indirect question introduced by 'hw\u00e1r' and\n    dependent upon 'wundur': _A secret is it when the hero is to die,\n    etc_.--Why may the two clauses not be parallel, and the whole passage\n    an Old English cry of '_How wonderful is death!'?_--S.'s is the best\n    yet offered, if 'wundor' means 'mystery.'\n\n    [3] For 'strude' in H.-So., S. suggests 'stride.' This would require\n    'ravage' (v. 16) to be changed to 'tread.'\n\n    [4] 'He cared ... sight of' (17, 18), S. emends so as to read as\n    follows: _He (Beowulf) had not before seen the favor of the avaricious\n    possessor._\n\n    [5] B. renders: _That which drew the king thither_ (i.e. _the\n    treasure_) _was granted us, but in such a way that it overcomes us._\n\n    [6] 'Folc-\u00e1gende' (3114) B. takes as dat. sing. with 'g\u00f3dum,' and\n    refers it to Beowulf; that is, _Should bring fire-wood to the place\n    where the good folk-ruler lay_.\n\n    [7] C. proposes to take 'weaxan' = L. 'vescor,' and translate\n    _devour_. This gives a parallel to 'fretan' above. The parenthesis\n    would be discarded and the passage read: _Now shall the fire consume,\n    the wan-flame devour, the prince of warriors, etc_.\n\n\n\n\nXLIII.\n\nTHE BURNING OF BEOWULF.\n\n\n{Beowulf's pyre.}\n\n          The folk of the Geatmen got him then ready\n          A pile on the earth strong for the burning,\n          Behung with helmets, hero-knights' targets,\n          And bright-shining burnies, as he begged they should have them;\n        5 Then wailing war-heroes their world-famous chieftain,\n          Their liegelord beloved, laid in the middle.\n\n{The funeral-flame.}\n\n          Soldiers began then to make on the barrow\n          The largest of dead-fires: dark o'er the vapor\n          The smoke-cloud ascended, the sad-roaring fire,\n       10 Mingled with weeping (the wind-roar subsided)\n          Till the building of bone it had broken to pieces,\n          Hot in the heart.

Of these a good part were avoided by Harrison and Sharp, the\nAmerican editors of Beowulf, in their last edition, 1888. The rest will, I\nhope, be noticed in their fourth edition. As, however, this book may fall\ninto the hands of some who have no copy of the American edition, it seems\nbest to notice all the principal oversights of the German editors.\n\n~From h\u00e1m~ (194).--Notes and glossary conflict; the latter not having been\naltered to suit the conclusions accepted in the former.\n\n~\u00de\u00e6r gel\u00fdfan sceal dryhtnes d\u00f3me~ (440).--Under 'd\u00f3m' H. says 'the might\nof the Lord'; while under 'gel\u00fdfan' he says 'the judgment of the Lord.'\n\n~Eal benc\u00feelu~ (486).--Under 'benc-\u00feelu' H. says _nom. plu._; while under\n'eal' he says _nom. sing._\n\n~Heatho-r\u00e6mas~ (519).--Under '\u00e6tberan' H. translates 'to the Heathoremes';\nwhile under 'Heatho-r\u00e6mas' he says 'Heathor\u00e6mas reaches Breca in the\nswimming-match with Beowulf.'

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."], "title": ["Beowulf"], "author": ["Beowulf Poet"]}
