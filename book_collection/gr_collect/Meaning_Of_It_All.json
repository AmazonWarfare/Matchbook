Feynman also emphasizes the distinction between questions that science can answer: \"what will happen\", and questions science cannot answer: \"what do I want to happen\".The second lecture, \"The Uncertainty of Values\" deals with his views on the relationship between science, religion and politics. Feynman acknowledges science's limitations and says that it does not have the value system that religions have, but adds that it can be used to help in making decisions.[8][9] He also stresses the importance of having the freedom to question and explore, and criticizes the (then) Soviet Union by saying that no government has the right to decide which scientific principles are correct and which are not.[10]In the third lecture, \"This Unscientific Age\", the longest of the three, Feynman discusses his views on modern society and how unscientific it is. Using a number of anecdotes as examples, he covers a range of topics, including \"faith healing, flying saucers, politics, psychic phenomena, TV commercials, and desert real estate\".[4]"], "good_reads_synopsis": ["Many appreciate Richard P. Feynman's contributions to twentieth-century physics, but few realize how engaged he was with the world around him\u2014how deeply and thoughtfully he considered the religious, political, and social issues of his day. Now, a wonderful book\u2014based on a previously unpublished, three-part public lecture he gave at the University of Washington in 1963\u2014shows us this other side of Feynman, as he expounds on the inherent conflict between science and religion, people's distrust of politicians, and our universal fascination with flying saucers, faith healing, and mental telepathy. Here we see Feynman in top form: nearly bursting into a Navajo war chant, then pressing for an overhaul of the English language (if you want to know why Johnny can't read, just look at the spelling of \u201cfriend\u201d); and, finally, ruminating on the death of his first wife from tuberculosis. This is quintessential Feynman\u2014reflective, amusing, and ever enlightening."], "genre": [["Nonfiction", "Science", "Philosophy"]], "title": ["The Meaning of It All Thoughts of a Citizen-Scientist"], "adapted": ["no"]}
